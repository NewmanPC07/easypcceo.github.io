<p>Thanks for confirming your subscription.</p>

<p>Here’s what you should expect:</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll be sending you a few emails teaching you how to buy gaming PC components for the low… I’m talking 1/5 of the retail price.</p>

<p>That’s right - you’re going to learn how I built my first gaming PC for $200, with an Intel i7 and a GTX 1080 Ti.</p>

<p>After you’ve learned how to get the best bang for your PC gaming buck, I’ll send over a weekly email to share more cool stuff with you.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep you up to date with the latest hardware news, insane deals and flash sales, tips, tricks, and more.</p>

<p>I promise to never spam your inbox like other email marketers do. Every email I send you will be packed full of value, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>And you can unsubscribe at any time - it won’t hurt my feelings!</p>

<p>That being said, check your inbox because the first money saving tip is probably there :)</p>
