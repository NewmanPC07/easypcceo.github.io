<p>Rust Server Hosting: A Complete Guide
With an average player base reaching upwards of 55-60,000, Rust has been one of the best indie successes in recent gaming history, and it‚Äôs showing no signs of stopping.</p>

<p>However, not all players are huge fans of the public rust servers, which are rampant with senseless griefing, profanity, and needless violence. Whether you want to opt for a PVE experience, you wanna just play with your friends, or you‚Äôd like to have some time to build up your base before opening the floodgates, there‚Äôs no question as to why dedicated Rust servers have been getting so popular.</p>

<p>But how do you go about making one?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-rust-server-hosting">What is Rust Server Hosting?</h2>
<p>Now, for the uninitiated, you don‚Äôt always have to pop into that public online Rust server and just work with whatever cards are dealt there. Hundreds of players are hosting their own private and public Rust servers to offer a better gaming experience for the community as a whole.</p>

<p>There are two types of player hosted servers you can get access to, but we‚Äôll talk about them more in-depth in the next section. The baseline, though, is that Rust players can have their servers for whatever reasons they might have to do so.</p>

<h2 id="rust-dedicated-server-vs-rust-server-hosting">Rust Dedicated Server vs. Rust Server Hosting</h2>

<p>As we mentioned prior, there are two different types of private Rust servers; Dedicated and Hosted. There are few differences in terms of user experience on the player end, but each has its pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="dedicated">Dedicated</h3>

<p>A Dedicated server, in simple terms, is a server hosted by a player on their home network, whether of their main computer or a separate dedicated computer that‚Äôs connected to their internet.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Free (besides having an internet connection)</li>
  <li>User serviceable</li>
  <li>Full freedom of customization</li>
  <li>Full control of server files</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Uses the host‚Äôs bandwidth</li>
  <li>Speeds are based on the host‚Äôs internet speeds</li>
  <li>Little to no protection from malicious cyber-attacks like DDOSing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hosted">Hosted</h3>

<p>A hosted server, on the other hand, is for those with some cash to spend for a good experience.</p>

<p>There are tons of online server hosting companies that‚Äôll host your game server for you if you pay a varying fee, of course. Do the benefits outweigh the cost?</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Generally faster than a dedicated server</li>
  <li>Tons of plan options to fit your server use case</li>
  <li>Encryption and protection from cyber-attacks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Not free</li>
  <li>May limit your control of the server in some cases</li>
  <li>May not allow direct access to server files</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="which-is-best-for-you">Which is Best for You?</h3>

<p>When choosing the best server option for you, there are a couple of factors that you should consider. Each server has its relative benefits, but it‚Äôs good to make an educated decision on what‚Äôs right for you.</p>

<p>First of all, do you plan on opening the server to the public? Or would you instead just form a private battle arena between you and some close friends?</p>

<p>Second, do you want to spend any money on the server? If so, how much are you willing to spend?</p>

<p>Third, do you want security for your server or a buffer from possibly malicious hackers to screw around with your server?</p>

<p>Dedicated servers will provide the lowest cost assuming you have a spare computer to host on or if you‚Äôre hosting from your main computer. Otherwise, you might have to buy whole new equipment just to host your Rust server. If you have that existing capability, though, you can get to hosting a server in a couple of minutes for entirely free.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with a dedicated server, you‚Äôll have little if any security, and if you want to host for a lot of people, your home internet may be a hindrance.</p>

<p>Hosted servers, on the other hand, cover almost all the bases. You get excellent security, the server can be hosted 24/7 without using your internet or desktop resources, and you can increase or decrease the player limit at will with no performance loss. And all this can be yours‚Ä¶ for a fee.</p>

<h2 id="free-rust-server-hosting-private-server">Free Rust Server Hosting (Private Server)</h2>
<p>If you don‚Äôt feel inclined to pay for a Rust server host and you‚Äôre okay with using your internet to host your server, a dedicated server is the way to go. So how can you set up your very own dedicated Rust server?</p>

<p>As long as you download the proper files and set it up correctly, you could have a private Rust server up and running in a matter of minutes. However, if you‚Äôre planning on hosting a public server for a large number of players, this option is not suggested.</p>

<p>Other things to note:
Running a server on your internet will take up a portion of your internet bandwidth, causing the connection for both you and the server to run slower</p>

<p>Running a server on your main computer (as opposed to a separate tower) will use some of your PC‚Äôs valuable resources which can lower your FPS in games while running the server</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-rust-server">How to Make a Rust Server</h2>
<p>To make your own rust server, we suggest you use a separate server box, but you can use your main computer if you‚Äôd like. Once you choose your device, it‚Äôs a simple matter of downloading files and setting configurations, easy stuff.</p>

<p>When you get your server up, you can go test it out yourself and try to invite some friends so you can make sure everything‚Äôs working correctly.</p>

<p>To learn how to host a free dedicated Rust server, head to our guide <a href="/game-hosting/rust/dedicated-server/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-running-your-own-rust-server">Advantages of Running Your Own Rust Server</h2>
<p>Owning a private Rust server can be full of perks to entice you. A combination of most of the positives and not too many negatives makes hosting a Rust server the perfect choice for the player looking for a friendly sanctuary or total control, but what can you expect to gain from opening a server yourself?</p>
<h3 id="avoid-angst-and-frustration">Avoid Angst and Frustration</h3>
<p>We all know how players are in these online survival games; that being straight-up awful.</p>

<p>The griefers who tend to ruin the game for newer spawns who‚Äôre trying to build up in the harsh world of rust. The stray player-hunters whose goals can only be described as barbaric. The hackers that fly around the map killing everything in sight indiscriminately ruining the game for everyone.</p>

<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it just be nice to be completely free from all that annoyance so you can truly have fun with the game? Why not go ahead and get a server up?</p>
<h3 id="everyones-on-a-level-playing-field">Everyone‚Äôs On a Level Playing Field</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve played Rust for more than a second you know the amazing feeling of spawning in ready to begin your journey to build, loot, and pillage only to catch a bullet, arrow, or rock to the dome for each time you spawn.</p>

<p>When you have the ability to decide who comes and goes on the server, you essentially have a way to level the playing field in a way, if you‚Äôre sick of all the tryhard clans invading and destroying entire servers.</p>

<p>You have the ultimate choice of what path the server takes, whether that be a public battleground where only the strong survive or a relatively peaceful land of war between prebuilt factions of close friends.</p>
<h3 id="total-control">Total Control</h3>
<p>Again, as the owner of the server, you‚Äôre the one who has complete control of the inner workings of the server. Whether you want to use that for personal gain or not is up to you.</p>

<p>You can morph the server to be whatever you want it to be, do whatever you want to do, and screw with anyone on the server you choose. And if you want to add mods to the server, you can do that too.</p>
<h3 id="rust-oxide--mod-support">Rust Oxide &amp; Mod Support</h3>
<p>Not all server hosts support modding for your Rust server, and there are some others that support it but have a difficult installation process. So be sure to pick a server with better mod support if modding is your goal.</p>

<p>Hosting your own dedicated server allows you free reign over the whole setup process, but you have to set up the whole thing yourself, of course. Lucky for you, we cover the Rust Oxide mod setup in our guide on <a href="/game-hosts/rust/dedicated-server/">How to a Rust Dedicated Server for Free</a></p>
<h3 id="experience-hosting-rust">Experience Hosting Rust</h3>

<h2 id="rust-game-server-hosting-companies-things-to-keep-in-mind">Rust Game Server Hosting Companies: Things to Keep in Mind</h2>
<p>All of the server hosts you‚Äôll encounter will have a similar set of features, but the quality between them may differ from host to host.</p>
<h3 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You Get What You Pay For</h3>
<p>The age old edict ‚ÄúYou Get What You Pay For‚Äù applies for any purchased product. Expect worse performance and feature sets from services that cost much less than proven high quality hosts, but at the same time don‚Äôt go overpaying for performance you don‚Äôt need.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre running a server for 5 people, you shouldn‚Äôt go paying for a server built to support 50 people.</p>
<h3 id="customer-support">Customer Support</h3>
<p>Similarly, customer support may vary across platforms and your individual experiences may vary. Since you usually can‚Äôt know what the customer service is like until you have a problem, we suggest that you look online for reviews on the customer service from users of each host.</p>
<h3 id="refund-policy">Refund Policy</h3>
<p>Server hosts don‚Äôt generally offer refunds for any reason other than an error on their part, but many services provide 7-30 day free trial periods to get a feel for the server or some sort of money-back guarantee if you don‚Äôt end up enjoying your experience with the service.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>One great way to gage the quality or reputation of a hosting service is by taking a look at the history of the company that runs it.</p>

<p>The first thing to take note of is how long the host has been on the public market. Newer hosts tend to have a lower quality of customer service and less fleshed out protocols to cover you if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>The second, is if the host has a relatively long history you should do some research on any large issues in the past that might‚Äôve diminished their reputation. Past issues can persist in the future in terms of quality control.</p>
<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>
<p>Just like with the customer service, you should find some reviews on the server hosts themselves to get a good idea of the personal experiences that other users have had and what to expect going in.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-host-a-rust-server">How Much Does it Cost to Host a Rust Server</h2>
<p>Server hosting doesn‚Äôt tend to cost a whole lot across the board and Rust servers are no different.</p>

<p>On average between hosts a Rust server can run you anywhere between $10 per month to $25 per month on most hosts. However, some hosts can reach up to $50 a month, while others like <a href="https://fragnet.net/games/rust-experimental">Fragnet</a> charge by the amount of player slots it will have.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-grow-a-rust-server">How to Grow a Rust Server</h2>

<p>For those of you who want to own a public server for random players to join and enjoy, you might have a bit of trouble getting people to join your server at first, but trust me, when the ball starts rolling it rolls fast.</p>

<p>One way to get new members to join is by advertising on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playrustservers/">Rust Server Directory</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/">PlayRust</a> subreddits. Try posting a thread with some information about your server.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can try posting on the official <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/rust">Rust discord server</a> or one of the many player-ran Rust fan servers that dot the internet.</p>
