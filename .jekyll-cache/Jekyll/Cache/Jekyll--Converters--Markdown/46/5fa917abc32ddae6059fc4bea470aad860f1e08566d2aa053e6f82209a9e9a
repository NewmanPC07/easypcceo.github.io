<h2 id="about-squad">About Squad</h2>

<p>If you somehow managed to make it to this article without learning about Squad, hereâ€™s a chance to enlighten yourself.</p>

<p>Squad is an online multiplayer shooter thatâ€™s goal is to bridge the gap between full-on military simulator games such as the Arma series and run &amp; gun arcade shooters like Call of Duty. In Squad, you work as a team, each person with their role, towards an objective or enemy, and you get punished for working alone.</p>

<p>Now that youâ€™re up to speed, wouldnâ€™t you love to participate in something like a 10v10, 20v20, hell a 40v40 military battle on your server where you make the rules? You can set the parameters, and you can decide the location, you can build your world.</p>

<p>So, what are some of the best server hosts you can use to get a perfect Squad server up and running for you and your community?</p>

<h2 id="how-we-picked">How We Picked</h2>

<p>We picked the best server hosts for you based on total cost, performance, price to performance, customer support, and prior server host experience with other games.</p>

<p>Each host has its strengths, so we urge you to choose based on the categories and what you think you need. For example, if you plan on hosting full clans of players ready to go at it 24/7, then maybe donâ€™t get the budget option, and if you only have a couple of friends and wanna fight each other, then you probably should go with a cheaper server based around slot prices.</p>

<h2 id="top-pick-vilayer">Top Pick: ViLAYER</h2>

<p>Our all-around top pic, <a href="https://www.vilayer.com/gaming-layer/gameinfo/squad.php" target=" _blank">ViLAYER</a> covers most of the bases when it comes to what you should look for in any game-server host.</p>

<p>In terms of pricing, their Squad servers are relatively average with a baseline price of $0.89USD per player slot per month. However, you must purchase a minimum of 20 slots for your Squad server. Additionally, you are given a choice between monthly, quarter-annually, semi-annually, and annual payment plans.</p>

<p>ViLAYER also has one of the broadest location support that weâ€™ve seen on any host. They can cover just about any location across the globe. The sheer amount of configuration offers provided to make it worthwhile to check out, and they include DDoS protection with every plan regardless of price.</p>

<h2 id="runner-up-gameservers">Runner Up: GameServers</h2>

<p>For our runner-up we give you <a href="https://www.gameservers.com/order/step2.php?game=308&amp;type=public&amp;players=10" target="_blank">GameServers</a> hosting. With a good reputation in hosting for a wide variety of games, their support for Squad is no different.</p>

<p>While their prices might be a bit higher than our top pick at $0.99 per slot, they have a threshold thatâ€™s half the price at just ten slots minimum for purchase. They do have payment plans at one month, three months, six months, and 12-month plans, but each plan increase offers a discount on the price per slot by an increasing percentage.</p>

<p>They also often offer coupon codes for even further savings, but their location support is much lower than most hosts with only specific cities around the world hosting servers. At the same time, you can also add a TeamSpeak, Ventrilo, or mumble voice server to your order for a small fee.</p>

<h2 id="also-awesome">Also Awesome:</h2>

<p><a href="https://serverblend.com/squad-server/" target=" _blank">Server Blend</a> is another reasonably good choice as it has relatively good options with pricing a little bit higher than some of our picks.</p>

<p>Server Blend well rounded, advertising benefits like a 14 satisfactions refund guarantee, anytime cancellations, 24/7 support services, and much more. Their Squad servers will run you about $12 for ten slots, but remember, <strong>they do not have any US Squad servers at the time of writing.</strong> You can, however, preorder the US servers as of now.</p>

<p>You can add a limited voice server plan, as well as a sub-domain, branding, Enjin website hosting, and a mod installation service.</p>

<h2 id="performance-pick">Performance Pick:</h2>

<p>Now, if speed is your need, then maybe you wanna try something like <a href="https://streamline-servers.com/gameservers/squad.php" target=" _blank">Streamline Servers</a>.</p>

<p>Out of all of our picks, theyâ€™re the most expensive Squad hosting, but hey, you get what you pay for, donâ€™t you? Streamline Servers live up to their name, offering a very streamlined and straightforward control panel for your server, alongside speedy connections and a reasonably large number of global server locations.</p>

<h2 id="budget-pick-citadel-servers">Budget Pick: Citadel Servers</h2>

<p>If you want cheap, we got you there too. With the $0.43 per player slot pricing at <a href="https://citadelservers.com/en-us/game-servers/squad-game-hosting" target=" _blank">Citadel Servers</a>, you can easily and quickly get a Squad server set up on the low.</p>

<p>With this kind of price, donâ€™t expect the best possible performance or variation in configuration options, but they do offer quite a bit for the price. Like other hosts, they have extensive payment plan options from monthly to annually, and each payment plan past monthly provides a discount.</p>

<p>The server locations are quite limited, but they offer paid performance increases, premium support plans, dedicated server hosting, and a dedicated IP option.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-squad-server-hosting-provider">How to Choose a Squad Server Hosting Provider</h2>

<p>Like we mentioned earlier in the first couple of sections, you need to choose a server based on what you plan to do with it. It may not seem all that important, but in the long term, it could mean the difference between $10 per month and $50 per month.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-a-large-clan-or-community">I Have a Large Clan or Community</h3>

<p>The higher the number of people you wish to host on your server simultaneously, youâ€™re going to need tons of slots and, more importantly, more processing power.</p>

<p>Hosts that allow you to get the most power out of the hosting server are going to give you the best experience with large numbers of people. If youâ€™ve ever experienced bad connections or rubberbanding, thatâ€™s how itâ€™ll feel with tons of people on a low power server.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-like-20-friends-i-wanna-play-squad-with">I Have Like 20 Friends I Wanna Play Squad With</h3>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some servers focus on low power, low cost, minimal player servers for the people who want a little miniature battle.</p>

<p>Budget servers are the best option for low headcount servers. Servers that charge by the slot are ideal, but you should compare prices to get your moneyâ€™s worth.
Dedicated vs Shared Squad Hosting</p>

<p>There are two simple designations of hosting for squad servers and often other types of game server hosting.</p>

<h3 id="shared">Shared</h3>

<p>Shared hosting is mostly standard amongst website hosts, though many game hosting companies offer shared game hosting as well. When you choose a shared hosting service, itâ€™s kind of like buying bargain bin stuff.</p>

<p>You get what you pay for in terms of performance. On a shared server, there are multiple Squad servers hosted off of the same resources, and thus each server has to share processing power and internet bandwidth.</p>

<h3 id="dedicated">Dedicated</h3>

<p>Dedicated is going to cost you a bit more than sharing on any hosting site because of the extra performance it can provide.</p>

<p>A dedicated server is essentially when the host has a server dedicated to hosting only your game. All resources are solely allocated to hosting your server, so you donâ€™t have to share bandwidth and processing power like with shared hosting.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-host-a-squad-server">How Much Does it Cost to Host a Squad Server?</h2>

<p>Squad server hosting can cost you, on average, anywhere between $10(USD) per month to $30 per month. However, that price can dramatically drop if you need a small number of slots, as there are hosts who charge under a dollar per slot.</p>

<p>As weâ€™ve said before (and weâ€™ll say again), you get what you pay for, at least most of the time. Donâ€™t go paying more than you need to, but donâ€™t employ a budget solution and expect anything close to world-class performance. Those people do exist.</p>

<p>All in all, compare prices to match your needs to get the most for your dollar when server shopping.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-game-modes-in-squad">What are the Game Modes in Squad?</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the game modes in Squad:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advance and Secure</li>
  <li>Random Advance and Secure</li>
  <li>Skirmish</li>
  <li>Destruction</li>
  <li>Insurgency</li>
  <li>Invasion</li>
  <li>Territory Control</li>
  <li>Shooting Range (Single player sandbox for training and practice)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-host-your-squad-server-free">How to Host Your Squad Server (Free)</h2>

<p>Alright, so, while you can host a Squad server for completely free of your home computer or separate computer on your network, itâ€™s really not a good idea.</p>

<p>First of all, the sheer processing power and system memory you would need to run an online game like Squad is a lot more than games like Rust, Ark, or Minecraft. Squad is designed for large simultaneous player counts, and it isnâ€™t cost-effective to host it from home.</p>

<p>On the same note, having large numbers of players connecting to a server on your home network isnâ€™t going to serve for a great gaming experience for you nor anybody else playing on the server.</p>
