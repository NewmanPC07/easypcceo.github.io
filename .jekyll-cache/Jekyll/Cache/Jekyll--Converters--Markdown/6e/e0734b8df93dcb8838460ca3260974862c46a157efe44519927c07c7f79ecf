<h2 id="about-arma-3">About Arma 3</h2>

<div class="vid-container">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDJE4-0AK5k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Arma 3 is one of the top games on Steam by concurrent player count, despite being released years ago. Itâs an open world, military sandbox shooter, that gives you the reigns and allows you to play as youâd like.</p>

<p>The game allows you to experience true combat gameplay in a massive military open world.</p>

<p>Mods are one of the best things about Arma 3, as theyâre what make the game fresh and playable to this day. Arma 3 has also given birth to many other games, like Player Unknownâs Battle Grounds, DayZ (and transitively, H1Z1). Arma 3 births other games!</p>

<p>Arma 3 aims to simulate real military combat, and it doe so quite well. Using bullet trajectory simulation, tools like compasses, range finders, and maps, and all of the military devices and vehicles you can think of, and an absolutely massive map, Arma 3 is even used for military training simulations.</p>

<p>Arma 3 is like a kitchen and the modders are cooks, who can turn the game into whatever experience they want. The game can be torn down to its shell and built back up again to become whatever you want.</p>

<h2 id="renting-an-arma-3-server-vs-hosting-your-own">Renting an Arma 3 Server vs Hosting Your Own</h2>

<p>You <em>can</em> host your own Arma 3 server on your PC, although Iâd highly recommend you rent a server instead.</p>

<p>Hereâs why:</p>

<p>Arma 3 isnât optimized well in the first place. Even top-tier gaming PCs have trouble breaking 60 FPS at max settings, not to mention the extra demand required by mods.</p>

<p>Notoriously CPU intensive, Arma 3 sucks the power out of your rig. The huge map, projectile simulation, and high slot servers consume your CPU power faster than the fat lady down the road can pound a Big Mac.</p>

<p>Hosting a server at the same time? Forget about it.</p>

<p>On top of having to run the game (which is hard enough), your PC now has to host the entire server at the same time. That means keeping track of everything, everyone, and more.</p>

<p>If you thought Arma 3 was laggy before, try hosting a server and playing at the same time. Now, you <em>and</em> everyone else on the server will lag too, since theyâre depending on your computerâs already so-so performance.</p>

<p>Hosting a dedicated server on your PC for a game like <a href="/game-hosts/terraria/">Terraria</a> is different. Terraria isnât very intensive on its own (itâs 2D), and having a few friends on your server isnât intensive either.</p>

<p>But the more assets and players on the server, the more resource intensive it becomes. Arma 3 is one of the most demanding games on Steam, and hosting a server is pretty intensive too.</p>

<p>Whatâs the bottom line here?</p>

<p>Renting an Arma 3 server from a hosting company is your best bet.</p>

<h2 id="arma-3-server-hosting-guide">Arma 3 Server Hosting Guide</h2>

<p>Here are some of the things to consider before hosting an Arma 3 server:</p>

<h3 id="one-click-mod-installs">One Click Mod Installs</h3>

<p>Mods are one of the best parts about Arma 3. Without them, we wouldnât have games like DayZ, PUBG, and many more. The game can be stripped down to its barebones and built back up to do exactly what you want.</p>

<p>If you want to host a game of Altis Life, for example, thatâs a mod. Same with Exile.</p>

<p>Choosing a server host that supports mods - more specifically, one click mod installs - is important.</p>

<p>You can save some money by choosing an Arma 3 host that doesnât support mods, but youâll almost surely regret it later on. If you want to switch to a hosting company that supports mods, youâll need to migrate the server (and the player base) which is a huge pain in the neck.</p>

<p>Conversely, you can choose a hosting company like GTX Gaming. They have instantly deployable servers for Arma 3 mods, which is pretty awesome. But better still, they feature game switching, which allows you to switch from game to game (or mod to mod) without having to migrate the server yourself, or buy another one.</p>

<p>That convenience comes at an added cost compared to cheaper hosting companies though, so it depends on your specific needs. If you know youâre only going to host one game mode for the life of your server, paying a premium for that flexibility probably isnât worth it.</p>

<h3 id="distance-from-you-and-your-players">Distance From You and Your Players</h3>

<p>All gamers have one thing in common: they hate lag. You donât have to be a die hard Arma 3 fan to agree with that, but Arma veterans hate lag more than most.</p>

<p>Full scale battles can get pretty intense, especially when competitive teams are fighting each other.</p>

<p>The farther you are from your server, the slower your connection will be. Whether you want to host your Arma server for fun with friends, practice with a team, or you want to grow a large community, good performance is essential.</p>

<p>Aside from choosing a good hosting company, making sure your server is close in physical proximity to you and your friends is one of the best ways to maximize your serverâs performance.</p>

<p>Distance from your server segways us nicely into the next topic:</p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>If you want to play Arma 3 with playable framerates, you ought to have a pretty powerful gaming PC. Likewise, Arma 3 servers need to have the right hardware for the job.</p>

<p><a href="/game-hosts/">Game server hosting companies</a> use slot count to determine the price of your server. More slots means a higher monthly payment and hopefully, better performance.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the game server company allocates more of their hardwareâs performance to accomodate a higher slot count server, but shady companies might sacrifice your performance to make an extra buck.</p>

<p>Thatâs why the importance of choosing a reputable hosting company cannot be overstated (like the ones above).</p>

<p>Here are the minimum performance requirements for an Arma 3 server, according to the official <a href="https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Dedicated_Server" target="_blank">wiki</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> 2.4GHz dual-core processor</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 2GB</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB HDD</li>
  <li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux/Windows Server 2008 (or better)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the recommended Arma 3 server requirements (these are the numbers you want to hit):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> 3.5GHz quad-core processor</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB+</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB SSD</li>
  <li><strong>OS:</strong> Linux/Windows Server 2008 (or better)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those numbers donât specify the slot counts, however, meaning your performance may vary depending on how many players are on your server. Modded Arma 3 server hosting will also require more performance than vanilla hosting.</p>

<p>Whatâs the bottom line here?</p>

<p>If youâre hosting a small server, you can probably get by with the minimum specs. But if youâre hosting a large server that needs top-notch performance, itâs best to spend more for top-notch hardware.</p>

<p>VPS hosting is not going to cut it for the majority of games, especially Arma 3. VPS servers share resources with several different people, limiting the power available to your server. VPS hosting services are okay for most websites, but thatâs not the case for gaming.</p>

<p>With a dedicated server, on the other hand, youâre getting access to the full power of the hardware youâre renting, meaning you wonât have to worry about someone else sucking up your serverâs resources.</p>

<p>All of the Arma 3 hosting companies above offer dedicated, pre-configured game servers that are immediately ready for use.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if youâre hosting an Arma 3 server, go with a dedicated host (unless you want to lag your butt off, which you donât).</p>

<h2 id="arma-3-modded-server-hosting">Arma 3 Modded Server Hosting</h2>

<p>Here are some of the most popular Arma 3 game modes:</p>

<h3 id="arma-3-life-server-hosting">Arma 3 Life Server Hosting</h3>

<p>Altis Life is a life simulator where you role play one of two characters: police officer and civilian.</p>

<p>This popular Arma 3 mod can be played without downloading any mods or anything like that. You can filter for them in the Arma 3 server browser, and youâll see a list of Altis Life servers appear. Once you join a Life server, youâll automatically download the files.</p>

<p>However, hosting an Altis Life server is a bit different. Some hosts require you to buy Arma 3 server hosting, and add the Altis Life mod later on in their control panel, which is a bit of a pain in the neck.</p>

<p>Instead, we recommend using a host that has instant deployment for Altis Life servers. That way, you can be up and running in no time.</p>

<p>GTX Gaming is probably the best Altis Life server hosting company. They offer instant deployment and game switching, meaning you can switch your server between Altis Life, regular Arma 3 game modes, and other Arma 3 mods.</p>

<h3 id="arma-3-exile-server-hosting">Arma 3 Exile Server Hosting</h3>

<p>Arma 3 Exile mod is much like <a href="/game-hosts/dayz/">DayZ</a>, which was based off of an Arma mod in the first place.</p>

<p>If youâre interested in Arma 3 Exile server hosting, GTX Gaming remains one of the best options. They have a lot of experience with Arma 3 Exile hosting, and instant Exile server deployment.</p>

<h3 id="arma-3-antistasi-server-hosting">Arma 3 Antistasi Server Hosting</h3>

<p>Renting an Antistasi server is a bit different than Exile or Life, because Antistasi is a mission, rather than a game mode. That means you have to rent an Arma 3 server, and upload the mission on the server.</p>

<p>Any of the Arma 3 hosting companies above will do, but Streamline Servers is highly recommended in Arma 3 forums and discussion groups on the web. Theyâve been around for more than 10 years, hosting Arma since the original release.</p>

<p>Streamline Servers has great Arma hosting support, terrific performance, and have good reviews as well. Best of all, they have hosting locations all around the world.</p>

<h3 id="arma-3-koth-server-hosting">Arma 3 KOTH Server Hosting</h3>

<p>Arma 3 KOTH (King of the Hill) is a popular multiplayer objective based control mission, where three teams fight for control of the hill. Players can employ the entire arsenal of Arma 3 weapons, vehicles and gear, although some KOTH servers turn vehicles off.</p>

<p>KOTH is an Arma 3 mission. That means setting up an Arma 3 KOTH server is similar to setting up an Antistasi server.</p>

<p>Most hosting companies donât offer instant deployment for Arma 3 KOTH - instead, you have to rent an Arma 3 server and configure the KOTH game mode yourself.</p>

<h2 id="arma-3-hosting-faq">Arma 3 Hosting FAQ</h2>

<p>Here are some of the most commonly asked questions I receive about Arma 3 server hosting:</p>

<h3 id="how-much-does-an-arma-3-server-cost">How much does an Arma 3 server cost?</h3>

<p>Arma 3 servers vary in price, ranging from around $20 per month to $80 per month and sometimes even more. Like <a href="/game-hosts/squad/">Squad hosting</a>, Arma 3 hosting is a bit more expensive than other games, because itâs a demanding title.</p>

<p>Most hosting companies charge based on the slot count of your server. Since Arma 3 servers typically have huge player counts (it is a large scale military simulator, after all) they can get pricey.</p>

<h3 id="how-much-ram-do-you-need-for-an-arma-3-server">How much RAM do you need for an Arma 3 server?</h3>

<p>Youâll need no more than 4GB of RAM for an Arma 3 server, 2GB being the minimum.</p>

<p>For more information, check out the <a href="https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Dedicated_Server" target="_blank">Bohemia Interactive Arma 3 Dedicated Server wiki</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="how-many-cores-for-arma-3-server">How many cores for Arma 3 server?</h3>

<p>In our tests, we found that Arma is barely multithreaded, meaning single threaded performance is the largest indicator of server performance.</p>

<p>You donât need more than a dual core CPU for Arma 3 hosting, although they do recommend a quad core CPU if possible. Still, CPU clock speed and the instructions per clock (power of the CPU) is more important than core count.</p>

<h2 id="arma-3-dedicated-server">Arma 3 Dedicated Server</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, hosting an Arma 3 dedicated server yourself isnât the best idea, unless you have a PC you can leave on 24/7 that isnât your main gaming PC.</p>

<p>Either way, if you want to host an Arma 3 dedicated server, hereâs a tutorial for you:</p>
