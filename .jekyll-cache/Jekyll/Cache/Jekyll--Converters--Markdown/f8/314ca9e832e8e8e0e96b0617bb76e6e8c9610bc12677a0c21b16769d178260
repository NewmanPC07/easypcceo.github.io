<h2 id="about-space-engineers">About Space Engineers</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload" alt="space engineers gameplay" data-src="/img/game-hosts/space-engineers/game.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the words of the devs themselves, ‚ÄúSpace Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration.‚Äù</p>

<p>Like other sandbox games such as Garry‚Äôs mod, Space engineers strives to provide a stimulating building experience with realistic physics on its volumetric-based physics engine. You can interact with everything, build, and destroy anything your heart desires.</p>

<p>Following its release on Steam Early Access in 2013, Space Engineers has garnered more than 3 million copies sold and has won many indie game awards during its lifetime.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a weird thought, the sheer numbers it reached from release to now, and it didn‚Äôt even exit Early Access until 2019!</p>

<h2 id="how-we-picked">How We Picked</h2>

<p>As for the server hosting list, we picked servers based around the same metric we use for all of our server lists.</p>

<p>We compared the total speeds of each host, their pricing, and the features that each host provides to customers. One host may be cheaper, but another may be easier to use, for example. Support is also a huge one for us, as is mod support.</p>

<p>Our top pick for Space Engineers server hosts had to go to <a href="https://www.gtxgaming.co.uk/clientarea/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=1" target="_blank">GTX Gaming</a>, no doubt.</p>

<p>GTX Gaming has Space Engineers with a minimum of ten slots and a maximum of 60 slots, coming in at $0.75 per slot. They offer up to 5GB of memory for free, but after that, you have to pay. If your world is huge (as most are in Space Engineers) you may need to pay extra.</p>

<p>They offer the best all-around server package alongside a wide array of configuration options for you to deck out your server with whatever power it might need. Plus, they‚Äôre one of the most affordable hosts you can buy, believe it or not.</p>

<p>Additionally, no matter where you are, they‚Äôve got a location closeby, ensuring optimal performance. We should note, however, that servers based in Stockholm, Sweden, and Sao Paulo, Brazil cost an extra $10 and $19, respectively.</p>

<p>PingPerfect‚Äôs Space Engineers servers start at $1.00 per slot, with discounts when you commit to longer term service agreements. Their Space Engineers servers start at 12 slots, and go up to 60 slots max.</p>

<p><a href="https://pingperfect.com/gameservers/space-engineers-game-server-hosting-rental.php" target=" _blank">PingPerfect</a> is one of our go-to‚Äôs when it comes to hosting a server for any game, so it shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone in the runner-up spot.</p>

<p>PingPerfect has a similar layout to that of GTX Gaming, but they offer a few more configuration options. Not only do they allow you to choose things like server branding and SSD hosting for better speeds, but their service area is much larger.</p>

<p>Like GTX Gaming, PingPerfect offers a couple of specific city-side hosting servers across the US. At the time of writing, their Miami, USA and New York, USA servers are sold out, but they still have just about anything else you could need.</p>

<p>PingPerfect also offers a 48-hour trial period to get a feel for the service.</p>

<p>GameServers offers Space Engineers server hosting for $0.99 per slot, starting at eight slots and going up to 60 slots.</p>

<p>When it comes to performance, <a href="https://www.verygames.net/en/" target=" _blank">GameServers</a> is almost unmatched for the price, but for that, you‚Äôve gotta get rid of some configuration options you‚Äôd get with other server hosts.</p>

<p>GameServers‚Äôs configuration menu is as simple and streamlined as it gets. No extra bells or whistles, and no extra hassle. Simply pick the game, server type, the number of slots, and location, then you‚Äôre ready to get started.</p>

<p>They give you the option to purchase a Teamspeak, Ventrilo, or Mumble voice server with your hosting, but you don‚Äôt have to choose any of them. Then, once you get to the payment terms, you can get incrementally increasing discounts by choosing longer time commitments.</p>

<p>For example, the monthly cost on a 3-month commitment is less than that of a single month. If you know you‚Äôre going to use the server for a while, buying a bulk package upfront makes the most sense.</p>

<p>For the budgeters out there, we couldn‚Äôt just leave out our favorite budget pick: <a href="https://hosthavoc.com/billing/aff.php?aff=1379" target=" _blank">Host Havoc</a>.</p>

<p>Now, while Host Havoc does offer the lowest per-slot price, it may not be as good as some of our top picks if you‚Äôre only planning on hosting a small number of players because the minimum slot count is 15, so just make sure you‚Äôre picking a host that‚Äôll get you your money‚Äôs worth.</p>

<p>Host Havoc has a tiered pricing system for their Space Engineers servers. They start at fifteen slots, for $0.75 a slot. But as you increase the slot count, the price per slot decreases, which incentivizes larger servers.</p>

<p>If you want to run a big Space Engineers server, Host Havoc is probably your best bet.</p>

<p>As for what else Host Havoc offers, the configuration is just as simple as GamerServers except for an added CPU priority option. Though, when you get into the server menu after purchase, Host Havoc has one of the best server dashboards out there.</p>

<p>You can even try out Host Havocs features before committing with their 72-hour Risk-Free Money Back Guarantee.</p>

<p>In terms of the rental period offerings, they have discounts from as little as 3 months all the way up to two years. You‚Äôre even given the option of hosting multiple servers and they provide discounts for those as well. There are even more cost savings to be had if you consider the player slot counts (6, 8, and unlimited) and their respective prices.</p>

<p>There are also addons like automatic backups to keep your server alive in case of a hardware hiccup, and extra disk space to make sure that your glorious builds can stretch the universe over.</p>

<h2 id="space-engineers-server-hosting-xbox">Space Engineers Server Hosting Xbox</h2>

<p>At this time, there is no available server hosting for Space Engineers on Xbox and no recent news regarding it.</p>

<h2 id="space-engineers-server-manager">Space Engineers Server Manager</h2>

<p>The Server Manager application has worked perfectly in many popular games recently, and Space Engineers is one of those.</p>

<p>This program allows you to, well, easily manage your dedicated server with a simple to navigate interface. Offering ease of use binds like auto-updating, auto-restart, bandwidth monitor, times backups, and so much more.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in downloading it, <a href="https://www.jimbobslimbob.com/filescat.asp?cat1=Programs&amp;cat2=Utilities" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="space-engineers-server-settings">Space Engineers Server Settings</h2>

<p>Before you start playing on your new Space Engineers Server, you should take a couple of minutes to go through the <a href="https://help.serverblend.com/en/article/dos-and-donts-with-your-space-engineers-game-server-16tq09g/" target="_blank">server settings</a> and configure some stuff.</p>

<p>First of all, setting a world size border limit is a must to either keep the game interesting with a massive world or reduce the required storage space with a small world. We suggest setting it to 2000.</p>

<p>Cleanup the server while the server is off, as to avoid any glitching or lost data. Never delete files while the server is running.</p>

<p>Never delete the SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg file.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to write a novel about Space Engineers server settings, but you get the idea.</p>

<h2 id="space-engineers-modding">Space Engineers Modding</h2>
<p><img class="lazyload" alt="space engineers server mods" data-src="/img/game-hosts/space-engineers/mods.jpg" /></p>

<p>As with all great sandbox games, Space Engineers has a wide array of <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/best-space-engineers-mods/" target="_blank">mods</a> you may add to your game to improve performance, gameplay, or just add some stupid stuff for fun.</p>

<p>The Space Engineers dev team supports modding and has even supplied a modding API that allows any mod creators to more efficiently and directly work with the game‚Äôs code.</p>

<p>They‚Äôve also provided the ModSDK application, which offers tools to creators to streamline the modding process.</p>

<p>Amazing!</p>

<h3 id="surface-occupation">Surface Occupation</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1135484957" target="_blank">Surface Occupation mod</a> attempts to alleviate the emptiness of planets in Space Engineers by adding randomly generated stations like defense and observation posts with which you can interact.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs quite a fun mod if you start getting sick of how desolate all of the planets seem.</p>

<h3 id="ship-ai-voice-basic">Ship AI Voice Basic</h3>

<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430267269" target="_blank">Ship AI Voice Basic</a> adds a bunch of unique voice lines to Space Engineers, making the worlds feel less lonely.</p>

<p>In this awesome mod, you can have your ship equipped with an AI of sorts that reacts to all of the things you do.</p>

<h3 id="exploration-enhancement">Exploration Enhancement</h3>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531659576" target="_blank">Exploration Enhancement mod</a> is a massive overhaul for Space Engineers that introduces tons of new mechanics to the game.</p>

<p>It feeds the roleplayer in all of us, adding things like trade, militaries, authorities, and many more factions to interact with. You have to play it to believe it.</p>

<h2 id="modded-server-support">Modded Server Support</h2>

<p>Most server hosts provide a smooth modding experience via automatic installs with the click of a button, while others give you direct FTP file access to connect your mods.</p>

<p>Either way, you can have some serious fun with modding your Space Engineers server.</p>

<p>Host Havoc and VeryGames explicitly offer easy mod installation and support for Space Engineers, while PingPerfect advertises their FTP access.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-host">How to Choose a Host</h2>

<p>Unlike many other multiplayer games, Space Engineers doesn‚Äôt seem like it was designed for massive multiplayer. Maybe just you and a couple of friends.</p>

<p>This design flaw can make choosing much more difficult, in the sense that almost every host is providing the same type of service instead of massively multiplayer versus small player slot servers.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre playing with people across the country or farther, then you should go for the fastest on our list. That way, you won‚Äôt have any connection issues, de-syncing, rubber banding, etc.</p>

<p>However, if you‚Äôre simply playing locally, then choose a cheaper server with locations closer to you so both you and your crew can connect and play without much issue or opt for a close server with a wide range of features.</p>

<p>For a full explanation on choosing the <a href="/game-hosts/">best server hosting company</a>, check out our guide!</p>

<h2 id="space-engineers-multiplayer">Space Engineers Multiplayer</h2>

<p>As we just mentioned, <a href="https://www.spaceengineerswiki.com/Multiplayer" target="_blank">Space Engineers multiplayer</a> isn‚Äôt like Minecraft, where you have tens or hundreds of people connecting to one server to play in an ever-changing world.</p>

<p>When you load up a Space Engineers server, you‚Äôre venturing into the unknown with a small band of merry men (or women) on a journey to build to the limits of the universe and create massive, awe-inspiring inter-galactic structures to showcase your brilliance.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-host-a-free-space-engineers-server">How to Host a Free Space Engineers Server</h2>
<div class="vid-container">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwCXhqtDNeM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Now, while Space Engineers already has a co-op feature in place so that players can directly connect and play together, you‚Äôve gotta ask, ‚Äúwhat if I wanna play while my friend is offline?‚Äù</p>

<p>That‚Äôs where dedicated, third-party servers come in. Just like other games, you can pay for a dedicated server with one of the hosts we listed above, but there‚Äôs always the option to host your server locally for absolutely free.</p>

<p>Again, the Space Engineers come in to save the day, offering an effortless setup for making a dedicated server through Steam. However, you do still need to do some port forwarding on your router to have out-of-network player connections.</p>

<p>Regardless, the dev team has a full walkthrough for dedicated server setup <a href="https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/dedicated-servers.html" target=" _blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="is-space-engineers-cross-platform">Is Space Engineers Cross-Platform?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Space Engineers is not cross-platform, nor does the dev team plan to introduce any cross-play features following the official release of Space Engineers on Xbox One.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-make-a-space-engineers-server-private">How Do You Make a Space Engineers Server Private?</h2>

<p>Making your Space Engineers server private is relatively easy.</p>

<p>On dedicated servers it‚Äôs as simple as this:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Make sure your server is off.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Create a Steam Group and add the players that you want to have access</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Find your configuration files and add the Steam Group ID to the Dedicated Easy Configurator file</p>

<p>And just like that, you‚Äôve got a private server!</p>

<p>With server hosts, on the other hand, for some hosts that offer FTP access, you can repeat those same steps, while other hosts may have private server options upon purchase.</p>

<h2 id="what-port-does-space-engineers-use">What Port Does Space Engineers Use?</h2>

<p>If you want to host a dedicated server and invite your friends from outside your network, you‚Äôll need to do a process called port forwarding on your router, which allows players to connect from outside sources.</p>

<p>When port forwarding, you need the specific port dedicated to the game you‚Äôre hosting a server for.</p>

<p>In Space Engineers‚Äô case, the port is 27016.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While Space Engineers might take a little work and know-how to get into enjoying, the payoff is worth it for sure. Nothing beats building a spaceship yourself to explore the Galaxy with your buddies and maybe fighting some pirates and stuff with mods.</p>

<p>Dedicated servers are an excellent route for Space Engineers because of the cost-saving and very low upkeep and resource draw, but purchasing a server host can still be viable in case you don‚Äôt want players connecting through to your network.</p>

<p>Plus, with paid servers, you can get all of the power you‚Äôll ever need to host 10, 30, 50 concurrent players in Space Engineers. Imagine how amazing of an experience that would be!</p>

<p>Whichever way you go, there‚Äôs always an option for you, and in the end, aren‚Äôt we all just here to have fun?</p>
