<p>ARK: Survival Evolved is an open world survival sandbox with some adventure style features.</p>

<p>As in Rust, DayZ and various other survival games, you’ll spawn in the world with the skin on your back, and that’s about it.</p>

<p>Despite these similarities, ARK is incredibly ambitious. Should you invest the time, the game will see you progress from naked man with a spear to futuristic power ranger with dinosaurs as pets.</p>

<p>But if you think you can hop in, play for a few hours and wield an army of dinosaurs and technology, you’re horribly mistaken. ARK takes a ton of time, energy, and in many instances, grinding before you can tame top-tier dinosaurs and wield immense power.</p>

<p>The game takes a lot of resource gathering and upgrading to progress through, which can get boring for some players.</p>

<p>However, there are servers with features that increase the speed at which you gather loot and level up. These options aren’t available on every server though.</p>

<p>If you want to take total control of your ARK experience, play with friends and have a blast without worrying about griefers or annoying rules, hosting your own ARK server is the best option.</p>

<p>In this article, we’re taking a look at some of the best ARK server hosting companies on the market.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="renting-an-ark-server-vs-hosting-your-own">Renting an ARK Server vs Hosting your Own</h2>

<p>Hosting your own server is fine for you and a few friends, but it’s not a good idea if you want to grow a real community on your server.</p>

<h3 id="dedicated-ark-server-on-your-pc">Dedicated ARK Server on Your PC</h3>

<p>Hosting your own ARK server is a bit challenging to set up if you’ve never hosted a server before, but there are step-by-step guides on the official ARK wiki like <a href="https://ark-survival-evolved.fandom.com/wiki/Dedicated_Server_Setup" target="_blank">this one</a>. You can follow the steps, and your server will be up and running.</p>

<p>Aside from being a bit more challenging, running a server requires a fast CPU and plenty of RAM, especially when you’re hosting a large server.</p>

<p>Open world games tend to use more RAM and CPU power than games like <a href="/game-hosts/tf2/">TF2</a> or <a href="/game-hosts/csgo/">CS:GO</a>. And more players will increase the server’s strain on your PC.</p>

<p>Think about it:</p>

<p>The game is already pretty performance hungry <em>without</em> a server running. If you’re already struggling to maintain 60 FPS in 1080p, your performance will be worse while running a large server.</p>

<p>Your friends will probably have a bad connection too if your PC can’t handle the server.</p>

<p>Server uptime is another big reason why hosting yourself may not be a great idea. The server will only be live when it’s running on your PC.</p>

<p>If your friendly only want to play when you’re on, this is fine - but ARK is a game that requires a ton of grinding, and odds are your friends will want to hop on without you, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This means you’ll need to leave your PC on at all times, <em>with the server running</em>.</p>

<p>And if you want to add any mods or DLC packs to your server, it’ll be tough to figure out on your own.</p>

<h3 id="renting-ark-server-hosting">Renting ARK Server Hosting</h3>

<p>That’s where ARK server hosting comes in - dedicated hosting companies like <a href="/game-hosts/gtx-gaming/">GTX Gaming</a> are experts in the field.</p>

<p>Renting from a company like them will make your life way easier - you’ll have better performance, 24/7 uptime, easy mod installation, and a dedicated support team to help you out (among other benefits).</p>

<h3 id="which-is-best-for-you">Which is Best for You?</h3>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, running an ARK dedicated server on your PC is totally doable, especially if you have a powerful gaming PC and only want to host a few friends. In that case, there’s little reason to pay for hosting.</p>

<p>But for most people - especially those who want to host a real server - should find a good hosting company (like one of the options above).</p>

<p>GTX Gaming’s ARK servers start at $11.31 for a 10 slot server, 5GB of memory, and a 3.8GHz server. That comes out to roughly $1.31 per slot.</p>

<p>But as you increase your slot count, the price per slot goes down. For example, a 30 slot server is $25.95 ($0.86/slot), and a 250 slot server is $79.10 ($0.31/slot).</p>

<p>Bulk discounts are great for server hosts that want a large server.</p>

<p>ARK is by far GTX Gaming’s top selling server right now, so they know what they’re doing.</p>

<p>Their ARK servers feature instant setup, and are Genesis ready. In fact, you can order an ARK Genesis server that’s ready instantly.</p>

<p>GTX Gaming is one of my favorite hosting companies (more on that in my <a href="/game-hosts/gtx-gaming/">GTX Gaming review</a>) for many reasons.</p>

<p>They have an automatic mod updater, 24/7 support, free DDoS protection, all ARK maps and DLCs, and a 24 hour refund policy to name a few.</p>

<p>Oh, and their game switching feature allows you to switch your ARK server out for any other game, whenever you want, free of charge.</p>

<p>GTX Gaming has a great support staff for the game, and an extensive knowledgebase.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they only support Steam PC ARK servers - if you want a server for the Xbox One or PS4, you’ll need to check out the section below about Nitrado.</p>

<p>But if you’re looking for an ARK server on PC, GTX Gaming is my top pick.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for a cheap ARK server hosting company, Citadel Servers is for you.</p>

<p>Their ARK servers start at $0.87 per slot with a minimum slot count of 15, bringing their minimum monthly payment to $13.05.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, however, that your location may have an impact on price.</p>

<p>Citadel Servers supports more than 1,000 ARK mods with one click installation, and free DDoS protection.</p>

<p>Their performance is pretty darn good for the price, and I had a pleasant experience with their support team as well.</p>

<p>All in all, Citadel Servers is a great runner up pick for the best ARK server hosting company.</p>

<p>Host Havoc is another great hosting company (more on that in our <a href="/game-hosts/host-havoc/">Host Havoc review</a>) because of their great performance, fair pricing and awesome support.</p>

<p>Host Havoc’s ARK servers start at just $0.50 per slot, but their minimum slot count is 30 players. This means their ARK servers start at $15/month.</p>

<p>However, Host Havoc’s ARK servers also use a tiered pricing system that heavily rewards buying a larger server.</p>

<p>When you buy a server with 100 players (their maximum slot count) the price per slot drops down to $0.30/slot.</p>

<p>Of course, you can add performance upgrades like extra CPU priority and additional RAM, but it’s totally optional, and for most, unnecessary. They also have a 72 hour money back guarantee on all of their ARK servers which is pretty dope.</p>

<h2 id="ark-server-hosting-for-ps4--xbox-one">ARK Server Hosting for PS4 &amp; Xbox One</h2>

<p>Nitrado is currently the main game server hosting company that supports ARK servers on Xbox One and PS4.</p>

<p>If you want to purchase ARK server hosting for the PS4, you can do so directly from the <a href="https://server.nitrado.net/usa/offers/ark-survival-evolved-ps4" target="_blank">Nitrado website</a>.</p>

<p>Renting an Xbox ARK server is a bit different. ARK is a game for Xbox One or Windows 10, so servers for it can only be ordered through the Nitrado App on the Microsoft Store.</p>

<p>As you can see below, Nitrado offers tiered pricing for their PS4 and Xbox One ARK servers:</p>

<p><img class="lazyload" alt="ark server hosting for PS4 and Xbox One" data-src="/img/game-hosts/ark/nitrado-servers.JPG" /></p>

<p>The more slots you buy, the cheaper your cost is per slot.</p>

<p>There are a few other hosting companies that offer ARK servers on console, but Nitrado is by and large the most reputable company in the console ARK server space.</p>

<h2 id="ark-mobile-server-hosting">ARK Mobile Server Hosting</h2>

<p>If you want to host an ARK mobile server, Nitrado is the official mobile server provider. You can rent a mobile server from their website, or you can open the Nitrado app from the ARK mobile server menu to rent your own server.</p>

<h2 id="ark-server-hosting-free">ARK Server Hosting Free</h2>

<p>You don’t <em>have</em> to pay for ARK server hosting, but there aren’t any free ARK server hosting companies. After all, free ARK hosting sounds more like charity than a business, and it’d probably suck.</p>

<p>If you want to host a free ARK server, you have to host it on your own PC.</p>

<p>Hosting yourself isn’t a big deal for a small server with a few friends, but like <a href="/game-hosts/rust/">Rust</a>, the open world of ARK is better when it’s running 24/7.</p>

<p>For reasons we already discussed at the top of this article, hosting yourself isn’t ideal, but it can be done.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning how to make an ARK server, here’s a video tutorial that’ll show you what to do:</p>

<h2 id="best-ark-server-mods-and-plugins-in-2020">Best ARK Server Mods and Plugins in 2020</h2>

<h3 id="grind-elimination-mods">Grind elimination mods</h3>

<p>ARK requires a TON of grinding before you can even tame a dinosaur, much less fly around in power armour.</p>

<p>If you want to remove some of the grind from the game and make building/crafting easier and more interesting, use a grind elimination mod.</p>

<h3 id="structures-plus">Structures Plus</h3>

<p>ARK is all about building and crafting, but the building mechanics in the game are far from great.</p>

<p>Structures Plus makes ARK’s building and crafting way easier. The mod fixes a ton of weird snap points and odd limitations.</p>

<p>You can also pick up things to move them, rather than destroying and replacing them. Lastly, you can pull resources from nearby containers, so you don’t have to run around to gather supplies before crafting.</p>
