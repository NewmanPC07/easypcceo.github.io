<h2 id="what-is-cable-management">What is Cable Management?</h2>

<p>Cable management is making sure you donâ€™t look like a complete PC building noob - in other words, keeping them nice and tidy inside your case. You should be organizing them in a way that doesnâ€™t totally suck.</p>

<p>You can have a PC with your cables nice and tidy:</p>

<p><img src="/img/cable-management/good-cable-management.png" alt="example of good cable management" /></p>

<p>Or you can have a PC with your cables running every which way, blocking airflow and making you look like a total noob:</p>

<p><img src="/img/cable-management/bad-cable-management.png" alt="example of bad cable management" /></p>

<p>Using a modular power supply is one way to improve your cable management (see our page on modular power supplies) as well as zip-tying your cables together and hiding them away in your case.</p>

<p>But one of the best ways to manage your cables is buying an <a href="/pc-cases/">awesome PC case</a> with good cable management options in the first place!</p>

<h2 id="why-is-cable-management-important">Why is Cable Management Important?</h2>

<p>Cable management is important because it improves the airflow in your case and makes it look much better than messy cables.</p>

<p>For example, on our page about <a href="/pc-cases/does-cable-management-matter/">cable management and airflow</a> we talk about whether or not cable management matters and show some examples of good cable management vs bad cable management.</p>

<div class="quote-box">
	<p>If your cables are all stuffed in your case, you've got a few problems on your hands. First of all, your cables will obstruct proper airflow. Secondly, anyone who looks in your gaming PC will be horrified by what they see! If you're proud of your PC, keep your cables nice and tidy.</p>

<p>This case from NZXT is a favorite of ours here at Easy PC. It has a sleek design and despite being a <a href="/pc-cases/smallest-atx-cases/">compact ATX case</a>, it has a spacious interior.</p>

<p>The H510i ships with two case fans pre-installed on the front panel, and a case fan on the rear of the case as well.</p>

<p>You can hide your power supply and any extra cables in the power supply shroud at the bottom, which helps keep temperatures down and your case looking clean.</p>

<p>There is a lot of room between the motherboard tray and the right side panel of the case, which makes it easy to run cables behind the tray and out of the way.</p>

<p>In addition, there are a ton of grommets and holes that you can use to route your cables, instead of having a big jumbled mess. But donâ€™t just take my word for it, you can check out this caseâ€™s glowing reviews on Amazon as well.</p>

<h2 id="cable-management-tools">Cable Management Tools</h2>

<p>A good case for cable management isnâ€™t all youâ€™re going to need. Any skilled PC builder has a few cable management tools in their belt.</p>

<p>Here are some of our recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Pair of Side Cutters</li>
  <li>Small</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Double Sided Tape</li>
  <li>Cable Mesh (optional but useful)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cable-management-tips">Cable Management Tips</h2>

<div class="vid-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkB-GNEt9Fk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>With your tools in hand and a good case, here are some of our best cable management tips:</p>

<h3 id="map-it-out">Map it out</h3>

<p>As we mention in our <a href="/cable-management/">cable management guide</a>, it doesnâ€™t have a big impact on performance, or even airflow. Cable management is almost purely for looks.</p>

<p>That being said, if you want your build to look awesome, you should have a battle plan in mind.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t want to have a bunch of wires running diagonally all over the place, even if theyâ€™re tied together. Cables should only appear to run vertically and horizontally for the best aesthetic.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t be afraid to map out your cable management plan on a piece of paper or the Paint application to get a better idea of what youâ€™ll be doing.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-the-small-cables">Start with the small cables</h3>
<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="small cables" data-src="/img/cases/cable-management/small-cables.jpg" />
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkB-GNEt9Fk">Linus Tech Tips</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Assuming you already have your build assembled, move the large cables out of the way (probably motherboard and CPU power) so you can start working on the tiny cables.</p>

<p>These could be your case fan wires, audio cables, and some of the other cables that come with your case.</p>

<p>Use the small zip ties to clean them up, using existing case crevices to hide them, in addition to the empty spaces where DVD drives used to go. They make for great nooks to hide your front IO cables.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-big-cables-in-mind">Keep your big cables in mind</h3>
<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="thick cable" data-src="/img/cases/cable-management/thick-cable.jpg" />
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkB-GNEt9Fk">Linus Tech Tips</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While running your small cables, think about where your main cables will (eventually) go. You can use the large cables to hide the small ones later on using the cable mesh sleeve we mentioned in the tools section.</p>

<p>Planning rocks!</p>

<h3 id="save-your-sata-cables-for-last">Save your SATA cables for last</h3>

<p>Since SATA data and power cables tend to be flimsy, you should save them for last.</p>

<div class="quote-box">
	<p>When I was building my first <a href="/budget-pcs/">budget gaming PC</a>, I was trying to manage my cables in a crappy case. Instead of saving my SATA cables for last, I wired them up and tucked them away first. Unfortunately, I ended up snapping the connector and breaking it when it got snagged on another cable I was working with.</p>

		</div>
</div>

<p>Moral of the story?</p>

<p>Donâ€™t cable manage your SATA cables until the end!</p>

<h3 id="rotate-your-fans-if-necessary">Rotate your fans (if necessary)</h3>
<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="rotate-fan" data-src="/img/cases/cable-management/rotate-fan.jpg" />
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkB-GNEt9Fk">Linus Tech Tips</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rotating your fans can often give a cleaner run to your fan connector.</p>

<p>Instead of having to run your cable across the fan, mount your case fan so that its cable originates closest to your fan power connector.</p>

<h3 id="label-your-fan-power-cables">Label your fan power cables</h3>
<figure>
<img class="lazyload" alt="label fan cables" data-src="/img/cases/cable-management/label-fans.jpg" />
<figcaption><p>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkB-GNEt9Fk">Linus Tech Tips</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labeling your fan power cables is going to make your life much easier when you want to reconfigure them in the future.</p>

<p>It will also help you reconfigure your RGB patterns when itâ€™s no longer obvious which cable goes where.</p>
