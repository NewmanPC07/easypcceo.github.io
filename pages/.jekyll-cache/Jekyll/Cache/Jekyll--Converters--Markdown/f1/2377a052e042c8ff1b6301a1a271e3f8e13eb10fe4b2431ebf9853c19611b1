<p>Hereâ€™s the deal:</p>

<p>You want to build a gaming PC that youâ€™re actually <em>proud of</em>. That means you canâ€™t have your cables in a big jumbled mess.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve created this guide - the first case I ever bought had terrible cable management, and I want to help you avoid the same mistake.</p>

<p>Today, weâ€™re taking a look at three of the best pc cases for cable management on the market today.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cable-management">What is Cable Management?</h2>

<p>Cable management is making sure you donâ€™t look like a complete PC building noob - in other words, keeping them nice and tidy inside your case. You should be organizing them in a way that doesnâ€™t totally suck.</p>

<p>You can have a PC with your cables nice and tidy:</p>

<p>Or you can have a PC with your cables running every which way, blocking airflow and making you look like a total noob:</p>

<p><img src="/img/cable-management/bad-cable-management.png" alt="example of bad cable management" /></p>

<p>Using a modular power supply is one way to improve your cable management (see our page on modular power supplies) as well as zip-tying your cables together and hiding them away in your case.</p>

<p>But one of the best ways to manage your cables is buying an <a href="/pc-cases/">awesome PC case</a> with good cable management options in the first place!</p>

<h2 id="why-is-cable-management-important">Why is Cable Management Important?</h2>

<p>Cable management is important because it improves the airflow in your case and makes it look much better than messy cables.</p>

<p>For example, on our page about <a href="/pc-cases/does-cable-management-matter/">cable management and airflow</a> we talk about whether or not cable management matters and show some examples of good cable management vs bad cable management.</p>

<div class="quote-box">
	<p>If your cables are all stuffed in your case, you've got a few problems on your hands. First of all, your cables will obstruct proper airflow. Secondly, anyone who looks in your gaming PC will be horrified by what they see! If you're proud of your PC, keep your cables nice and tidy.</p>
