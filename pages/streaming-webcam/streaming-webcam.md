## What to Consider Before You Buy

**Video Quality:** If you want to build a following on a popular streaming platform like Twitch.tv, you have to stream with high quality video. It's important that you buy a webcam that's at least 720p HD. Otherwise, nobody is going to want to watch your stream, even if you're streaming amazing content. Think about it: why would someone want to watch your stream in low resolution when they could easily watch someone else who streams higher quality content?

**Framerate:** These days, most people are streaming in 60FPS, rather than 30FPS. The video quality is noticeably smoother when streamed with a higher FPS rate. If you're streaming gameplay in 60FPS, for example, but your webcam can only capture 30FPS, it may look a bit wonky. I'd recommend streaming in all 30FPS or all 60FPS, rather than one of each. 

**Connection Type:** Most webcams connect to your computer via a USB cable, but double check just to make sure your wecbam and your computer are compatible. 

**Microphone Quality:** If you're going to take streaming seriously, I'd highly recommend buying a different microphone. Webcam microphones, no matter how good, cannot compete with dedicated studio microphones. You'll sound distant and your audio quality will be terrible. Instead, check out a dedicated microphone like the [Blue Snowball](https://amzn.to/2uYS20g){: target="_blank"}, [Blue Yeti](https://amzn.to/2mV94YJ){: target="_blank"}, or the [Audio Technica AT2020](https://amzn.to/2uX7j1A){: target="_blank"}. 

## Do You Need a 1080p Webcam for Streaming? 

If you're only planning on including a small facecam in the corner of your stream, you don't *need* a 1080p webcam. 

The video captured from the webcam will be downsized on viewers' screens, so it is hard to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p. 

If you're going to display your facecam on the full screen, you'll want to go for a 1080p webcam. Higher resolution is never a bad thing!
