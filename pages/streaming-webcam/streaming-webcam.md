## [Logitech C922 Pro Stream](https://amzn.to/2Ka2O8T){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ka2O8T"><img alt="Logitech C922 Pro Stream" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/streaming-webcam/logitech-c922.jpg" /></a>

Logitech's new [C922 Pro Stream](https://amzn.to/2Ka2O8T){: target="_blank"} is an even better webcam than its already impressive predecessor, thee Logitech C920. 

Boasting fantastic 1080p video quality and the ability to record in 60FPS, this camera is great for streaming. 

The camera also supports background removal and impressive low-light correction, which is ideal for YouTubers and streamers alike. 

As far as design goes, the C922 looks similar to its younger brother, the C920. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

As you can see in this [review](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3127780/consumer-electronics/logitech-c922-review-like-the-c920-it-replaces-this-webcam-gets-the-job-done.html){: target="_blank"}, the C922's image quality is impressive, even in the dark. Overall, it's a fantastic camera for streaming, as it offers good image quality at an affordable price.

## [Razer Kiyo](https://amzn.to/2NYlhrf){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NYlhrf"><img alt="Razer Kiyo" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/streaming-webcam/razer-kiyo.jpg" /></a>

Razer is a gaming company, so it's not surprising that this webcam is pretty much focused entirely on streaming. 

The [Razer Kiyo](https://amzn.to/2NYlhrf){: target="_blank"} has done away with many fancy features – instead, Razer is offering streamers exactly what they want, without any additional bells and whistles. 

If you decide to purchase the Kiyo, you'll enjoy good 1080p image quality and superb lighting, thanks to Razer's Light Ring. 

The Light Ring is Razer's lighting detection technology – rather than wasting time trying to adjust your lighting before the stream, simply plug in your Razer Kiyo, and you're ready to begin!

## [Best Budget Streaming Webcam: Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000](https://amzn.to/2M7bqir){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M7bqir"><img alt="microsoft lifecam hd-3000" class="img-small img-right" src="/img/streaming-webcam/microsoft-lifecam-hd-3000.jpg" /></a>

The [Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000](https://amzn.to/2M7bqir){: target="_blank"} is an excellent webcam for anyone who wants to take their stream to the next level, without breaking the bank. 

For around $20, you're getting a device capable of recording in 720p, which is perfect for video calls and stream face cams. As long as you keep the facecam small in proportion to the rest of your stream, your viewers won't be able to tell your video resolution is lower. 

The camera also features automatic color correction, a noise-cancelling unidirectional microphone and a stand for both laptops and desktops. 

I'd like to mention, however, although the noise cancelling microphone is nice, it's always best to use a dedicated microphone for streaming.

This camera is a great way to dip your toe in the water without fully committing to an expensive camera.

## [Mevo](https://amzn.to/2Ma4lxG){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ma4lxG"><img alt="Mevo" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/streaming-webcam/mevo.png" /></a>

If you think you're going to livestream or record on the go, the [Mevo](https://amzn.to/2Ma4lxG){: target="_blank"} is the streaming device for you. 

This portable streaming webcam allows you to capture video and stream it from anywhere in the world, as long as you have an internet connection on your cell phone. 

It can record in 1080p resolution, it has a wide field of view, and a decent built-in microphone (I'd still highly recommend a dedicated microphone for the best possible sound quality.) 

The microphone also features automatic color correction, a hi-fi microphone, and Skype support.

## [Logitech C930e](https://amzn.to/2v5hYaN){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2v5hYaN"><img alt="logitech c930e" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/streaming-webcam/logitech-c930e.png" /></a>

The [C930e](https://amzn.to/2v5hYaN){: target="_blank"} is Logitech's most advanced HD webcam, but it's also one of the most expensive webcams on the market. 

Unlike most HD webcams which rely on the PC to do all of the hard work, this webcam encodes its own video. 

The result?

Better video quality and a lighter load on your PC. The wide 90-degree field of view is great for videoconferencing and streaming, too. 

The webcam is capable of 1080p video recording and streaming, and it has a Zeiss wide angle lens. 

It's expensive, but it is also one of the best webcams on the market. If you want a high quality facecam for your stream, this webcam is a strong contender.

## What to Consider Before You Buy

**Video Quality:** If you want to build a following on a popular streaming platform like Twitch.tv, you have to stream with high quality video. It's important that you buy a webcam that's at least 720p HD. Otherwise, nobody is going to want to watch your stream, even if you're streaming amazing content. Think about it: why would someone want to watch your stream in low resolution when they could easily watch someone else who streams higher quality content?

**Framerate:** These days, most people are streaming in 60FPS, rather than 30FPS. The video quality is noticeably smoother when streamed with a higher FPS rate. If you're streaming gameplay in 60FPS, for example, but your webcam can only capture 30FPS, it may look a bit wonky. I'd recommend streaming in all 30FPS or all 60FPS, rather than one of each. 

**Connection Type:** Most webcams connect to your computer via a USB cable, but double check just to make sure your wecbam and your computer are compatible. 

**Microphone Quality:** If you're going to take streaming seriously, I'd highly recommend buying a different microphone. Webcam microphones, no matter how good, cannot compete with dedicated studio microphones. You'll sound distant and your audio quality will be terrible. Instead, check out a dedicated microphone like the [Blue Snowball](https://amzn.to/2uYS20g){: target="_blank"}, [Blue Yeti](https://amzn.to/2mV94YJ){: target="_blank"}, or the [Audio Technica AT2020](https://amzn.to/2uX7j1A){: target="_blank"}. 

## Do You Need a 1080p Webcam for Streaming? 

If you're only planning on including a small facecam in the corner of your stream, you don't *need* a 1080p webcam. 

The video captured from the webcam will be downsized on viewers' screens, so it is hard to tell the difference between 1080p and 720p. 

If you're going to display your facecam on the full screen, you'll want to go for a 1080p webcam. Higher resolution is never a bad thing!

## Conclusion

Live streaming is growing ever more popular these days – no wonder you want to start streaming yourself! 

Viewers enjoy streams with facecams more than streams without, probably because they feel more of a connection with the streamer if they can see them. After all, live interaction is one of the best parts of a stream.

If you want to start streaming, including a facecam is crucial. However, cameras can be expensive. As long as you keep your facecam in the corner of your stream's screen, a 1080p webcam (or even a 720p webcam) will do the job. 

They're a great way to dip your toe in the water without having to shell out a massive amount of money. You can't go wrong with any of the streaming webcams listed above!
