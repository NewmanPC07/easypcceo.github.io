Experiencing connection issues during gameplay is incredibly frustrating. One minute you're dominating, and the next you're dead. 

The worst part is, if you're lagging, you can't really do anything about it â€“ *or can you?*

If you have slow WiFi, you'll have to upgrade your router or internet connection. However, your internet connection problem may be due to a poor WiFi signal.

In order to establish the best possible connection to your router, you'll want to use a high speed gaming ethernet cable.
