Experiencing connection issues during gameplay is incredibly frustrating. One minute you're dominating, and the next you're dead. 

The worst part is, if you're lagging, you can't really do anything about it â€“ *or can you?*

If you have slow WiFi, you'll have to upgrade your [router](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-router-2618162){: target="_blank"} or internet connection. However, your internet connection problem may be due to a poor WiFi signal.

In order to establish the best possible connection to your router, you'll want to use a high speed gaming ethernet cable.

## How to Choose the Best Ethernet Cable for Gaming 

If you're going to spend your hard earned money on an ethernet cable, you'll want to ensure you're buying the best one for your needs. Here are some things to keep in mind before you buy a gaming ethernet cable: 

* **Length:** The length of an ethernet cable has a direct impact on connection speed. As the cable becomes longer, signal quality decreases, resulting in reduced network performance and sluggish transfer rates. Look for the shortest ethernet cable possible, as long as it is long enough to reach your Xbox One, PS4, or [PC](/budget-pcs/). I'd recommend finding an ethernet cable no longer than 300 feet. 

* **Compatibility:** Ensure that your ethernet cable is compatible with your gaming system, whether it be an Xbox One, PS4, or PC. Many ethernet cables are manufactured by an [OEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer){: target="_blank"} (Original Equipment Provider) brand. If so, it should work with your system without any issues. 

## Cat5e vs. Cat6 Ethernet Cables

According to [Diffen.com](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Cat5e_vs_Cat6){: target="_blank"}: 

<blockquote source="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Cat5e_vs_Cat6">
	<p>Cat6 cables, also called Category 6 or Cat 6 cables, provide lower crosstalk, a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and are suitable for 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet), while Cat5e cables support only up to 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet). As a means of future-proofing your network, Cat6 is generally a better choice and worth the small premium in price. Cat5e and Cat6 cables are both backwards compatible, which means newer Cat6 cables can be used with older Cat5e, Cat5 and even Cat3 equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

Essentially, Cat6 cables are newer, and are capable of transferring faster than older Cat5e cables.

Both cables are interchangable, and work the same way. However, Cat6 cables are newer and faster. 

If you do decide to go for Cat6 cables, you'll need to upgrade *all* of the other cables in your network to Cat6. Otherwise, your old Cat5e cables will slow down the network.

## [Best Budget Gaming Ethernet Cable: Mediabridge RJ45 Cat5e 25ft Cable](https://amzn.to/2JvXEDJ){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JvXEDJ"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="mediabridge rj45 gaming ethernet cable" src="/img/gaming-ethernet-cable/mediabridge-rj45.jpeg" /></a>

The [Mediabridge RJ45 Cat5e ](https://amzn.to/2JvXEDJ){: target="_blank"} is a great budget gaming ethernet cable. 

Measuring in at 25ft, the cable is long enough to reach your gaming setup, even if it's in another room. If you'd prefer a cable that is a different size, you can order a longer or shorter version of this ethernet cable. 

It comes with gold-plated connectors which help to provide a more reliable connection. The cable is capable of transferring 1000Mbps, and the connectors are easy to insert and remove. 

For the price of just $7, this is an amazing gaming ethernet cable. As far as gaming performance goes, this cable works tremendously. 

During my tests, I did not experience any network difficulty. I played several games, streamed on Netflix, and downloaded a program, all without any issues. 

For less than $10, this is a fantastic Cat5e gaming ethernet cable. 

## [RiteAV Cat6 50ft Cable](https://amzn.to/2Jt4qdD){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Jt4qdD"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="RiteAV Cat6 50ft cable" src="/img/gaming-ethernet-cable/rite-av.jpg" /></a>

The [RiteAV Cat6 50ft cable](https://amzn.to/2Jt4qdD){: target="_blank"} has 50 micron gold plated connectors for a fantastic data transmission. When I tested this cable, it passed each one with flying colors. Downloads were fast, my gaming connection was perfect (less than 15 ping), etc.

Compared to my old Cat5e cables, I was surprised by the noticeable difference between the Cat5e and Cat6. Especially when you consider this cable's low cost, it only makes sense to upgrade. 

If you're a gamer wanting to improve your connection, I'd highly recommend this ethernet cable. 

## [Importer520 Cat6 RJ45 50ft Cable](https://amzn.to/2NT6sqV){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NT6sqV"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Importer520 Cat6 RJ45 50ft Cable" src="/img/gaming-ethernet-cable/importer520.jpeg" /></a>

The [Importer520 Cat6 RJ45 50ft cable](https://amzn.to/2NT6sqV){: target="_blank"} has a standard PVC jacket, and male to male connectors iwth a snagless molded strain relief.

The cable is 50 feet long, which means you can run the wire from your router to your gaming setup, even if it is in another room. Keep in mind, however, that the longer your cable is, the weaker the connection becomes. A 50 foot cable is not going to have much of an effect on connection, but it isn't negligible. 

As far as connection goes, the Importer520 is another fantastic gaming ethernet cable. It's a Cat6 cable, which is ideal for gaming. If you want to futureproof your infrastructure, buying a Cat6 ethernet cable is a good idea. 

## Conclusion 

If you want to improve your internet connection, a Cat5e or Cat6 cable is a great way to do so. A direct connection will always be faster than a wireless connection. If you decide to buy a Cat cable, make sure it is long enough to reach your gaming setup (but not too long, or it will hurt your connection.)

Lastly, if you decide to upgrade to a Cat6 cable, you'll have to upgrade *all* of your ethernet cables, not just one. If you don't upgrade the rest, your Cat6 cable will still work because it is backwards compatible. Although, you'd be wasting your money on the Cat6 cable, because it would be slowed down by the Cat5e cables. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
