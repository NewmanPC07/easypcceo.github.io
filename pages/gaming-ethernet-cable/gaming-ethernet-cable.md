Experiencing connection issues during gameplay is incredibly frustrating. One minute you're dominating, and the next you're dead. 

The worst part is, if you're lagging, you can't really do anything about it â€“ *or can you?*

If you have slow WiFi, you'll have to upgrade your router or internet connection. However, your internet connection problem may be due to a poor WiFi signal.

In order to establish the best possible connection to your router, you'll want to use a high speed gaming ethernet cable.

## Cat5e vs. Cat6 Ethernet Cables

According to [Diffen.com](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Cat5e_vs_Cat6){: target="_blank"}: 

<blockquote source="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Cat5e_vs_Cat6">
	<p>Cat6 cables, also called Category 6 or Cat 6 cables, provide lower crosstalk, a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and are suitable for 10GBASE-T (10-Gigabit Ethernet), while Cat5e cables support only up to 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet). As a means of future-proofing your network, Cat6 is generally a better choice and worth the small premium in price. Cat5e and Cat6 cables are both backwards compatible, which means newer Cat6 cables can be used with older Cat5e, Cat5 and even Cat3 equipment.</p>
</blockquote>

Essentially, Cat6 cables are newer, and are capable of transferring faster than older Cat5e cables.

Both cables are interchangable, and work the same way. However, Cat6 cables are newer and faster. 

If you do decide to go for Cat6 cables, you'll need to upgrade *all* of the other cables in your network to Cat6. Otherwise, your old Cat5e cables will slow down the network.

The ## [Mediabridge RJ45 Cat5e ](https://amzn.to/2JvXEDJ){: target="_blank"} is a great budget gaming ethernet cable. 

Measuring in at 25ft, the cable is long enough to reach your gaming setup, even if it's in another room. If you'd prefer a cable that is a different size, you can order a longer or shorter version of this ethernet cable. 

It comes with gold-plated connectors which help to provide a more reliable connection. The cable is capable of transferring 1000Mbps, and the connectors are easy to insert and remove. 

For the price of just $7, this is an amazing gaming ethernet cable. As far as gaming performance goes, this cable works tremendously. 

During my tests, I did not experience any network difficulty. I played several games, streamed on Netflix, and downloaded a program, all without any issues. 

For less than $10, this is a fantastic Cat5e gaming ethernet cable.
