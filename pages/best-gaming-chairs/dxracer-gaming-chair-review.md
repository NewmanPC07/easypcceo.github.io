## The Importance of a Quality Gaming Chair

While you can sit on any old chair, we highly recommend investing in a proper gaming chair. For starters, racing style gaming chairs look awesome. When you sit down in your gaming chair in front of your gaming setup, you'll feel like a champion.

While we're on the subject of feeling like a champ, sitting in a gaming chair with proper back support will help you feel good even after hours of gaming. 

I used to use a regular kitchen chair to sit on during my gaming sessions. After the first hour or so, I'd grow uncomfortable. I found myself constantly trying to readjust my positioning and rubbing my aching back. 

When I finally upgraded to a proper gaming chair, my back pain was gone, not to mention I felt like a king sitting in my gaming throne.
