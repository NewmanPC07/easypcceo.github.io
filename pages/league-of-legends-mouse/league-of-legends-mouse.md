The [Mionix Castor Multi-Color Ergonomic Optical Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2A8rzT0){: target="_blank"} is suited for right-handed gamers, and it is compatible with every mouse grip style. 

The mouse has six programmable macro buttons – moreover, it has pinky and ring finger support, which helps to prevent hand crams even after hours of gaming. 

The Mionix Castor comes in multiple colors which are highly customizable (over 16.8 million options). 

Now onto performance: is the Mionix Castor League of Legends worthy? 

The answer is yes.

The mouse ships with a 5,000DPI sensor. The cursor was responsive, and my mouse movements were smooth. Additionally, its ergonomic design keeps my hand comfortable, even after hours of use. 

The mouse is especially well suited for League because of it has six programmable buttons. If you’re playing LOL competitively, programmable buttons are important.

## [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n){: target="_blank"} 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Deathadder Elite" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-deathadder-elite.jpg" /></a>

The Razer DeathAdder Elite came out during DeathAdder’s 10th anniversary back in 2016. 

It is a wired mouse, with a maximum DPI of 16,000 and a max polling rate of 1000Hz – evidently, the mouse’s specifications are impressive. During my tests, I thoroughly enjoyed using the mouse.

So much so, that I decided to use it in my PC gaming setup. I’ve been using the DeathAdder Elite for several years, without any complaints!

Although the Elite has a similar design to other DeathAdder models, it features several additional programmable buttons, which are great for League of Legends. There is a sleek curve to both sides of the mouse, making it perfect for a palm style grip. 

In addition to the programmable buttons on the side of the mouse, the DeathAdder Elite features two additional buttons located right below the scroll wheel. They are discrete but easy to access with your finger during gameplay. 

The DeathAdder Elite contains Razer’s Synapse 2.0 software. The Synapse software is used to manage buttons, button profiles, customize RGB lighting, and manage settings such as the DPI.

This mouse is great for League of Legends, but it can also be employed for use in FPS games, battle royale games, and more. It’s an all-around mouse from a reputable company.

## [Best Razer Mouse for League of Legends: Razer Naga Hex V2](https://amzn.to/2JWNgVN){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JWNgVN"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Naga Hex V2" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-naga-hex-v2.jpg" /></a>

The Razer Naga Hex V2 is the second version of the Naga Hex. It utilizes a laser sensor and a wired connection to minimize input delay. This 1000Hz mouse has a maximum DPI of 16,000. 

The mouse also has 14 programmable buttons – although this may seem overwhelming, the design of the mouse makes the buttons easy to use. Furthermore, having 14 programmable buttons is ideal for MOBA games such as League of Legends

There are seven buttons by the thumb. On top of the mouse, you have the typical left and right click buttons along with the scroll wheel. There is a DPI button located below the scroll wheel as well. 

While this mouse is not the most aesthetically pleasing, it makes up for it in gameplay. This mouse has a raise on top instead of on the side, along with an elevated palm rest. To my surprise, I found this mouse quite comfortable during gameplay.

The Naga Hex V2 also contains the Synapse Software which can be used to customize your experience.

The lighting in the Hex V2 is also highly customizable. There are three separate zones, all of which can glow in unison, or separated to illuminate three different colors. 

Overall, this mouse is best used best for MOBA gameplay. The buttons on the side can take a little getting used to, but the mouse surely gets the job done after a little bit of adjustment.

The BenQ ZOWIE FK1 has a simple and straightforward design. It is relatively light and uses the Avago 3310 optical sensor. 

It has an adjustable DPI sensor – you can choose from 400, 800, 1600, and  3200 DPI. The mouse is ambidextrous, with thumb buttons on both the left and right side. 

It is a “plug and play” mouse, meaning it doesn’t require any drivers for setup. This is especially good news if you want to hop right into the action!

This mouse has an adjustable USB report rate of 125, 500, and 1000Hz. 

The ZOWIE FK1 is employed not only for League of Legends gamers but professional FPS gamers as well. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players love this mouse. 

A true MOBA mouse for League should have plenty of programmable buttons. This mouse only has four, but it’s one of the best mice on the market. I’d recommend this mouse to anyone looking to play a mix of League of Legends, and other games too.

If you don't want to deal with a corded gaming mouse, I'd highly recommend the [Logitech G903](https://amzn.to/2LLw87c){: target="_blank"}. It's a wireless mouse that uses the PMW3366 optical sensor, with a maximum DPI of 12,000.

It is more expensive than most wired gaming mice, but it's a price you'll have to pay for a good wireless mouse. 

The mouse is ambidextrous, so both right handed and left handed users can use it. The mouse

It is also extremely lightweight, weighing in at just 107 grams. Overall, it's easily one of the best wireless gaming mice on the market today.
