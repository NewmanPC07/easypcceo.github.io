The 400C has a sleek metal plated front panel, and overall the design of the 400C exudes a feeling of subtle sophistication. I know it sounds corny, but it's true. 

We especially love the acrylic side panel window that can be easily opened with the window's handle. 

The 400C has a clean, modern, and minimalistic design with an entirely steel exterior.

The overall design of the case feels sleek and refined. It has a nice black finish with a large side-panel window, allowing you to peek inside and take a look at your components. 

Although it's not flashy, when you step into the room, the case has a presence. 

Its minimalistic design is almost graceful in a way – its visual points of interest are subtler compared to other flashy cases with bright lights that are dying for attention.

Corsair manages to pull this off thanks to its awesome dual-chamber design. 

The components that don't require active cooling are moved to the back. 

This way, airflow isn't wasted on the parts that don't really need it – definitely a cool design by Corsair. 

It's an ATX Cube chassis, meaning the motherboard, CPU and GPU were compartmentalized from the rest of the build.

In order to achieve this feat, Corsair had to widen the chassis. The case is actually using a dual chamber design. 

One chamber is for your motherboard and 3.5" drive bays, while the other chamber houses the power supply, solid state drives, and 5.25" bays. 

Both chambers streamline airflow to provide the best possible cooling solution. On top of the compartmentalized interior, Corsair has also left room for water cooling compatibility and HDD bays with back planes. 

Despite being a small ATX case, the Carbide Air 540 is very well designed. 

Its two compartments keep cables and components neat and tidy, which promotes airflow, thus keeping the entire rig looking good and staying cool. 

The case is mostly constructed of steel on the inside, but Corsair decided to use ABS plastic and steel mesh to give the cube ATX case a unique and good-looking style.

The case has a simple design but it still looks great - available in both black and white, the NZXT H500i has a nice side panel window and a bunch of cool features. 

For starters, it comes with an Adaptive Noise Reduction Algorithm that changes fan speed automatically based on temperatures. This way, your case fans will only run as hard as they need to, thus reducing noise and increasing efficiency. 

The NZXT H500i has a simple design that will exceed your expectations in terms of build quality for its price point. 

This case comes with all of the fancy bells and whistles you'd expect from a high end case at this price point. 

With this model, the H500i has a smart hub for fan control and a built-in RGB strip up top and behind a cable cover. 

This case has a sleek white paint job that's minimalistic but super good looking. 

It also features a nice side panel window that allows you to display your components, illuminated by the case's RGB lighting.

Unlike a lot of other cases on the market, this one has a unique design that makes it stand out from the crowd. 

That unique feature is, of course, the dual-chamber design. 

Components that don't need direct cooling (PSU, hard drives) are stored in the bottom chamber, and the motherboard goes in the chamber on top where most of the airflow is. 

This makes it so no airflow is wasted – the components that need to be constantly cooled get maximum exposure to your case fans, and the components that aren't as important stay tucked out of the way. 

As an added bonus, in case you're always on the go, this case also has nice carrying handles that make transportation easy. 

That being said, if you're the kind of gamer that likes to have LAN parties, this is the casse for you.

In recent years, Thermaltake has produced many cases that are largely popular, especially their Core series. 

The Thermaltake Core G3 is no exception, offering a stylish full sized form factor without being too big and bulky. 

It's also one of the cheaper cases on this list, so you could use it if you're building a cheap gaming PC. 

Somehow this case can house a full sized ATX motherboard despite how slim it is. 

Unfortunately, since the case is so small, cable management is a bit of an issue - that's really our only complaint about the case. 

The [cable management has an impact on airflow](/cable-management/), but the case is ventilated all around, so the interior still remains cool during operation. 

All in all, it's a fantastic case for the money.

## Case Buying Guide

![Carbide Air 540](/img/case/carbide-air-540.png){: .img-right .img-small}

If you're interested in building a gaming PC, it is imperative that you choose the [right case](https://www.computercaselab.com/what-makes-a-computer-case-the-best-for-gaming/){: target="_blank"}. Of course, that's easier said than done. 

In an effort to aid those new to building gaming computers, I've created this guide to help you understand everything you need to know when it comes to selecting the best ATX case. 

**So, what's the deal with ATX, micro-ATX, and mini-ITX?** 

The names stem from motherboard size categories. Motherboards are grouped into these three categories.

ATX is the largest, micro-ATX is a bit smaller, and mini-ITX is the smallest. 

At the moment, full-sized ATX cases are the most popular form factor for a variety of reasons. 

ATX motherboards are 12 × 9.6 inches (305 × 244 mm). ATX cases are usually also compatible with micro-ATX motherboards, which are 9.6 × 9.6 inches (244 × 244 mm). 

Lastly, mini-ITX motherboards are 6.7 × 6.7 inches (170 x 170 mm), making them the smallest of the three form-factors. 

Since cases are responsible for housing motherboards, cases are categorized in the same manner (ATX, micro-ATX, etc.) 

It's always important to ensure that the case you want is compatible with your motherboard's form factor. 

## A Great Case Is... 

**1.** A great gaming case is strong. Avoid cases constructed with flimsy plastic – after all, your case is supposed to protect your parts and keep them from breaking, right? 

A few plastic parts here and there are okay and most cases have some plastic. However, ensure the plastic is strong and of high quality before risking your expensive components. 

**2.** A great gaming case has fantastic [airflow](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/215986-how-important-is-airflow/){: target="_blank"}. If your case doesn't have good airflow, your PC could overheat and shut down. 

Despite being able to handle high temperatures, your parts can become damaged if they are too hot. Whether you're using 80mm, 120mm, or 140mm case fans, *airflow is incredibly important!*

</div>

**3.** A great gaming case has room for plenty of *quiet* case fans! This goes hand-in-hand with airflow. If your case doesn't have space to add case fans, it's a no go. 

![Thermaltake Core G3](/img/case/thermaltake-core-g3.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

Most gaming cases ship with fans included – many of them have cool looking LEDs too. 

But before you're fooled by fancy lights, it's important to make sure your fans are quiet. 

Noisy fans can be especially annoying if you're sensitive to noise. 

**4.** A great gaming case has enough room for your components! This may seem obvious, but some cases don't have enough room for CPU coolers and graphics cards. 

For example, the first time I built a gaming PC, the hard drive bays in my case got in the way of my graphics card!

**5.** A great gaming case has good cable management options. This means there is plenty of space for your cables, and they can be run throughout the case in a neat and orderly fashion. 

Instead of bundling them up inside the case – which is both ugly and bad for airflow – you can run your cables in the back. 

This keeps your case looking clean and promotes good airflow.

Before you pull the trigger on the case of your dreams, make sure that: 

* Your graphics card will fit inside the case
* Your CPU cooler will fit inside the case
* Your case has enough hard drive bays

Otherwise, you'll be quite disappointed!

## Do You Need a 'Gaming' Case?

Many companies advertise their cases as "gaming cases". Just because a case is outfitted with cool LED lights does not necessarily make it a gaming case. 

Most uneducated customers will buy a case simply for its looks, without really considering the factors mentioned above. 

It is more important to find a functional case that provides good airflow and cable management. A good case must also be sturdy and cost effective. 

Sure, a good looking case is always nice, but it is *not* necessary. If you're on a budget, especially a budget below $500, don't spend more than $50 on your case. 

In fact, I'd recommend spending $40 or less. 

## Corsair Carbide Series 400C Review

Let's take a closer look at our favorite case on the list:

### Case Design 

<div class="vid-container">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNPT0zqS5rc?start=6" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

The 400C has a clean, modern, and minimalistic design with an entirely steel exterior.

The overall design of the case feels sleek and refined. It has a nice black finish with a large side-panel window, allowing you to peek inside and take a look at your components. 

Although it's not flashy, when you step into the room, the case has a presence. 

Its minimalistic design is almost graceful in a way – its visual points of interest are subtler compared to other flashy cases with bright lights that are dying for attention. 

<figure>
<img class="img-middle" alt="back of corsair carbide 400c" src="/img/case/corsair-carbide-400c-back.jpg" />
<figcaption><p>Image courtesy of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/344852/corsair-carbide-clear-400c">PC Mag review</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>

This case, on the other hand, knows it's good-looking, and doesn't have to show off to get the attention it deserves. 

On a more serious note, I'd like to talk about the actual design features of the case. 

The 400C measures 464 x 215 x 425mm (HxWxD) and weighs in at around 18 lbs. It's a smaller version of it's big brother, the 600C, but the case doesn't feel cramped. 

The outside of the 400C is mostly steel, but the door handle, feet, and ventilation dividers are made of plastic. Overall, the case is of a solid construction.

### Features 

In today's day and age, people are consuming their media much differently than they used to even a few years ago. 

[Optical drives](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2858639/why-you-might-still-want-an-optical-drive.html){: target="_blank"} are becoming less common, as most of the data you'd need can be downloaded directly to your computer's hard drive, which have also grown in storage capacity. 

Moreover, rather than popping your favorite movie into the DVD player, most people choose to watch movies and TV shows via their favorite online streaming service, such as Netflix or Hulu. 

![Corsair 400C inside](/img/case/400c-inside.png){: .img-middle}

Corsair has taken note of this shift, and decided to remove 5.25-inch optical drive bays entirely from this case. 

Although some people may be disappointed by this decision, in my opinion, it's actually a good choice. 

The case doesn't have optical drive bays, which frees up space for other things, including case fans, multiple GPUs, radiators, and extra space between hard drives which results in cooler temperatures. 

Moreover, the interior of the case is more spacious, which promotes better airflow. Lastly, the case can accomodate motherboards as large as E-ATX, which is pretty awesome. 

### Installation 

It comes with a pre-installed 140mm fan in the front. If you wish, you can remove the 140mm fan and install three 120mm case fans instead. 

You can even add another two 120mm or 140mm fans in the top of the case, or mount a water cooling radiator up to 360mm in size. 

The case supports up to five storage devices, two of which are 3.5-inch drives and two 2.5-inch drive bays for SSDs. 

The power supply and the removable 3.5-inch drive cage are both protected by overlapping plastic shrouds. When the plastic shrouds are there (they're removable), they hide most of the case's wiring, giving it a cleaner look and feel. 

![Corsair 400C case airflow](/img/case/carbide-400c-airflow.png){: .img-middle}

The case also has several cable cutouts, which are lined with rubber. 

There are three next to the motherboard tray. If you're installing a Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX board, you may find it difficult to use the cutouts all together. It really depends on the length of your cables. 

The 400C isn't a flashy case, but it's still a classy case with a low-profile. 

Despite its slightly smaller size, the case can hold a lot, thanks to Corsair's decision to get rid of 5.25-inch drive bays. 

The case doesn't have any fancy LED lighting, a common trait among gaming cases. However, it does ship with a nice side-panel window, and you can always add case fans with LEDs if you wish. 

I'd like this case a bit more if its cable cutouts were placed differently, as it's somewhat difficult to use them unless you have an ATX or E-ATX motherboard. 

Nevertheless, it's not the end of the world, and they get the job done. 

What's the moral of the story here? 

If you're hunting for the best smallest ATX case, the Corsair Carbide 400C should be a strong contender on your list of possible candidates. 

### Review Summary

Don't be fooled by advertisements and flashy lights. A great case is sturdy, provides good airflow, has a spacious interior, etc. 

Of course, the more you pay, the higher quality case you'll have. Nowadays, there are so many case options to choose from it becomes overwhelming.

It is a way to show off your personality – at the same time though, it's important to buy a case that's functional. If you are building a new gaming PC on a tight budget and you have an old computer laying around that you don't use anymore, don't be afraid to tear out the old parts to reuse the case! 

At the end of the day, the your PC build comes down to your budget, your personal preferences, and what you're looking to do with your PC. That's the beauty of PC gaming – you can tailor your PC to suit your needs!
