Here's how much a game server costs:

**It depends on the host you choose and the game. Generally speaking, gaming servers can range from $5 per month to $150 per month. The cost of a game server depends on how many player slots you want, and the type of game you're playing. For example, small [Terraria servers](/game-hosts/terraria/) will cost less than a large [Arma 3 server](/game-hosts/arma-3/).** 

That's the short answer, but it's a bit more complicated than that. 

Let me explain: 

Back when I wanted to host my first [Rust server](/game-hosts/rust/), I didn't really know what I was doing. 

After trying to setup a [dedicated Rust server](/game-hosts/rust/dedicated-server/), I realized I needed to find a good [host](/game-hosts/) instead.

Before anything else, I was wondering how much it would cost to host a game server. 

Now, after years of hosting experience in a variety of different games, I've learned it depends on a variety of factors. 

In this article, your'e going to learn exactly how much it costs to host a variety of different game servers, and why. 

Let's dive in: 

## What is a Game Server?

This video will probably explain things better than I can:

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server){: target="_blank"} 

<blockquote><p>A game server (also sometimes referred to as a host) is a server which is the authoritative source of events in a multiplayer video game. The server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its connected clients to maintain their own accurate version of the game world for display to players. They also receive and process each player's input.</p></blockquote>

Basically, everyone in the game connects to the server. The game server tracks all of the players in the game, their location, direction, gear, health, base locations, etc. 

The larger the map and the more players in the game, the more processing power the server must use. 

## How Much Does it Cost to Run a Game Server 24/7?

As mentioned above, renting a server will cost you $5-$150 per month, depending on how you scale and the game you're playing. 

But running the server yourself, is a different story. If you want to setup a server in your home or office, you'll save a lot of money. Rather than paying a hosting company, you only have to pay for electricity. 

On average, a server can use between 500 to 1,200 watts per hour. If the average use is 850 watts per hour, multiplied by 24 in a day cmoes out to 20,400 watts daily, or 20.4 kilowatts (kWh). So that means it would cost $731.94 to power the game server yourself for one year.

## How Much Does an MMO Server Cost? 

MMO servers cost much more than other game servers because they have far more players gaming at once, which means more for the server to process. 

The cost of MMO server primarily depends on two factors:

**1.** How many concurrent players you plan to serve 

**2.** The efficiency of your custom server technology 

A user on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-costs-of-running-a-server-for-an-MMO){: target="_blank"} has an incredibly thorough and somewhat complicated answer. 

Simply put, an MMO can cost you anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand per month, depending on how many concurrent players and locations you want to support. 

For example, a 50k concurrent player base on an MMO may cost you ~$1500 per month, even with a bulk discount. 

## How Much Does a Minecraft Server Cost?

Minecraft servers are far cheaper than MMO servers, but they can still get pricey. 

Minecraft servers can fill up quickly, and so can their monthly rental fee.

Most people will pay between $5-$30 per month for a Minecraft server. Pricing depends on how many concurrent players you want to support. More players means more RAM, and more RAM means more money. 

Those figures are for small Minecraft servers, however. That number can grow to more than $100 per month for large communities. 

[Apex Hosting](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-much-ram-do-i-need-for-my-server/){: target="_blank"} has a great chart on their website that shows exactly how much RAM you need for your server, and how much it'll cost you. 

Here's their summary: 

**1GB:** – This is the recommended plan for basic small vanilla servers. The best choice for a small group of friends or family.

**2GB:** – A fantastic plan if you are also planning to add some base plugins or mods and increase your player base on your server.

**3GB:** – Use this plan if you are planning to install medium-sized modpacks or plugin packs. This is suggested for up to 25 mods or plugins.

**4GB:** – This plan includes all of the most known modpacks available. For modpacks up to 35-40 mods or plugins, this is the best choice for you.

**5-12GB:** – These packs are able to support over 40 mods or plugins. These are only suggested if you are planning to start a big community. The bigger it is, the more RAM you should get.

**16GB:** – For very large communities and extreme modpacks or plugins, this is the plan you are looking for. Make sure you know what you are doing before picking this plan.

The amount of RAM you choose has a direct impact on pricing. 

## How Much Does an ARK Server Cost?

Survival games like ARK, Rust and [DayZ](/game-hosts/dayz/) tend to cost anywhere from $15 to $80 per month. 

They're generally cheaper than MMO servers because they have far less players.
