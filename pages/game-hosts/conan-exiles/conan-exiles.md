# Best Conan Exiles Server Hosting
With the survival game craze still on the horizon and millions of people across the globe still sitting on stay-at-home orders, it’s no wonder why Conan Exiles is still one of the most played indie games on the market.

Conan Exiles offers single player, co-op, and multiplayer, but one of the biggest draws of survival games like Conan Exiles is the online multiplayer experience, so what is Conan Exiles without its multiplayer? That’s right, nothing. Thus, it’s important that you make the absolute most out of the multiplayer experience to enjoy the game!

However, just as in any online survival game, the public servers can be quite a hassle to deal with if you’re new to the game or just want to build up in your own little corner. Griefers and raiders will always find a way to get your stuff.

So, how do we prevent this? Private server hosting of course! Hosting a private server for you and your friends can be a great way to learn the ins and outs of a game at your own pace while still getting the online experience required.

We’re here to help you find the best server hosts for your Conan Exiles server, whether private, public or solo these are our top picks for the best Conan Exiles server hosts on the market.

### What is Server Hosting
As we mentioned before, many games in the survival genre that Conan Exiles belongs to are meant to be played online, it’s part of the experience. Though, the public servers are definitely not friendly to new and returning players or PVE players.

By hosting your own server you get to choose who joins or leaves and what the rules are, you get full control of your game’s world. This can be enticing for friendly multiplayer, modding, and so much more.

There are two types of hosting, however, and it’s good to keep in mind what your options are with the pros and cons of both.

### Conan Exiles Dedicated vs. Paid Server Hosting
Between the two server hosting types there are a couple of notable differences, but the most striking one is pricing.

While paid server hosting services can range anywhere from $5 to $100 per month for verifying levels of quality, dedicated server hosting is completely free with the exception of your internet bill.

#### Hosted
Servers hosted by a server host are going to be your best bet if you’re hosting for a large number of players (10 or greater) and can provide more reliable connections for the players. Hosted servers are online 24/7 and require no input or regular maintenance on your part.

The service provider can handle all issues internally on their end and you can contact the support teams any time you run into issues with your server. It’s just those pesky monthly fees that get you, but we think they’re worth it for the benefits.

##### Pros:
* Generally faster than dedicated
* Ease of use
* Provided support teams
* Quick setup
* Multiple pricing and plan options
* DDoS and hacking protections

##### Cons:
* Never free
* Usually no access to server files
* Can limit server control

#### Dedicated
Dedicated servers are going to be the best course of action for servers with lower player counts and servers acting for players joining on a local connection. Hosting a dedicated server requires your computer to stay on while hosting the server, or a separate computer that stays on to host the server.

If you’re hosting a server off of your own personal computer (the one you’ll be playing games on) you could run into performance issues both server-side and while playing the game since your computer now has to split resources between the two.

Even if you host the server on a separate computer in your home, if you are keeping it on 24/7 it will slow your internet speeds and could cost you extra money on your internet bills if your service plan has a data cap.

Dedicated hosting is suggested only for those who are tech-savvy or willing to learn the ins and outs of server hosting complications.

##### Pros:
* Complete control of the server down to the code level
* Modding support in all cases
* Free
* Faster when on local only

##### Cons:
* Requires more bandwidth on your network (could slow internet speeds)
* Large servers = a bad idea
* No hacking protections
* Can be difficult to set up
* Server speed is based on the host’s internet

## Best Conan Exiles Server Host

### Ping Perfect

##### Pros:
* Great performance
* Free trial
* On-call support team
* Competitive pricing
* Global Servers
* Covers tons of games
* Tons of options

##### Cons:
* Much more expensive compared to other hosts
* Support documentation is lacking in some areas

It would make sense that the highest performer on our list happens to be the best host here; that being Ping Perfect.

Ping Perfect’s Conan Exiles server hosting starts at $0.76USD per slot (you can change the currency) and the minimum number of slots is 15, though the cost per slot can be reduced with longer payment plans or higher slot counts. 

With the extra cost, you get access to the wonderful Ping Perfect support team, alongside many other features. If you’re looking to use a custom domain, whether registering for the first time or transferring, Ping Perfect can handle it all within the setup menu. They also offer the ability to transfer your old Conan Exiles server over to their service for a $10 fee.

Their other features include SSD Hosting (highly recommended), Server Branding, CPU Priority, and Platinum Support packages. Learn more about them on our Ping Perfect review page.

## Runner Up Host

### Host Havoc

##### Pros:
* Plugin and mod support
* Best support team
* 99.9% Uptime
* Easy-to-use control panel
* Servers around the world

##### Cons:
* No free trial
* High minimum slot count (30)

Host Havoc is a more balanced server host, focusing more on being well rounded rather than pooling into one aspect.

While their prices can tend to be a little more on the pricey side for most games, they aren’t all that much more expensive for Conan Exiles; that being $0.50 per slot with a minimum of 30 slots. There are also discounts based upon higher slot counts and longer payment plans.

Just like with Ping Perfect, you can also register a domain for a custom server IP (suggested for larger branded servers).

## Budget Host

### Citadel Servers

##### Pros:
* Cheapest host on the market
* Good support
* Reliable servers

##### Cons:
* Lower performance than competitors

It’s really hard to beat the pricing of Citadel Servers for any games, but it’s also not like you have to give up much for those savings.

Starting at $0.43USD per slot and a minimum count of 15 slots, Citadel Servers easily offers the cheapest possible coverage, and with world-wide servers, there’s a high likelihood there’s a server network near you.

If you thought this was the most money you could save, we’re just getting started. Citadel Servers’ configuration menu applies 3%, 6%, and 10% discounts for Quarterly, Semi-Annually, and Annual payment plans respectively. Additionally, increasing the slot count will reduce the price per individual slot.

## What’s the Most Important Part of a Conan Exiles Server
Since Conan Exiles is a survival/crafting game, the server’s CPU clock speed is going to play a big part in keeping crafting working properly and entities moving the way they should. Thankfully many server hosts will have options for faster processors or CPU priority to get the best speeds.

Of course, having your server on solid state storage is always going to help. Keep in mind that some server hosting services also offer NVME SSD hosting which is almost 5x faster than traditional SATA SSD transfer speeds.

Higher levels of RAM is only going to be important on larger servers as there are tons more people actively using the game’s resources at the same time. On a small server, a baseline of 8GB should be fine for up to even 10 players. Beyond that, though, it might be wise to start looking into 16GB options. You’ll only need more than that with 30+ players.

We also mentioned earlier that, for home-hosted servers at least, internet bandwidth can become problematic for several reasons. If you have slow internet, a large number of devices on your internet or data caps, a personally hosted server can and will run slow or cost you tons of money in data fees.

## Average Conan Exiles Server Rental Pricing
Pricing is going to be a big focus when renting a server, and when renting larger servers for games such as Conan Exiles, your price per slot will be very important.

Most server hosting services, regardless of the game, are going to offer discounts based upon the number of slots your order and if you choose longer payment plans. This can be a great way to either save a little cash or get a better bang for your buck in the end.

For small Conan Exiles servers, hosting can run you anywhere from $0.30USD per slot to $0.50USD per slot. That 20 cent difference may not seem like a lot, but think about it like gasoline; the more you buy, the faster the charges rack up. So making use of any discounts available to you is vital.

Mind you, that doesn’t necessarily mean go buy more player slots than you need just because it seems like your saving money. Make sure you’re prepared for exactly what you need before renting a server.

Also, many server hosts offer extras and upgrades for your server for a little bit more money. This can range from RAM upgrades to SSD storage, so on and so forth. It all comes back to what you really need for your server. While you may not need a ton of RAM for just a couple of friends on a server, it’ll help when tons of players are simultaneously running around and changing the world. We always suggest going for SSD storage if possible.

If you run a larger server, it may also help to opt for higher-priced premium support packages to make sure the server is running its best at all times. Hosts like GTX Gaming offer CPU speed upgrades and priority support, both of which are going to help larger servers get along smoothly.

For small servers, the best thing is to stick with the cheapest options without splurging too much on upgrades. Unless you really need the server to run at its maximum possible speed.

## Conclusion
Conan Exiles is one of the most fun and fastest growing survival games on the market right now and knowing all you can about the ins and outs of server hosting can keep you on top of the game with your server.

Whether big or small, modded or vanilla, there are tons of options to choose from and you can always find a service to suit your needs perfectly. Though, to be fair, renting a server is most likely going to provide the best experience all around.

But regardless, you could set up your own dedicated server from your home computer to maybe just hang around or learn how to play with your closest friends, or you could try to battle the big dogs and become one of the top Conan Exiles servers around. No matter your goal, there’s always a perfect solution just for you.
