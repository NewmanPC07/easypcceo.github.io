## [Polk Audio T50 (Single)](https://amzn.to/2M2xkqh){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M2xkqh"><img alt="Polk Audio T50 (Single)" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/tower-speaker/polk-t50.png" /></a>

The [T50](https://amzn.to/2M2xkqh){: target="_blank"} doesn't have any fancy features, but it definitely gets the job done. This 36.25" high enclosure speaker is a great speaker for those of you on a budget. 

Drivers include a one-inch silk dome tweeter, a 6.5-inch composite cone woofer, and two 6.5 passive radiators. 

If you want to set up a home theater system, buying a few Polk T50s is a good choice. The speaker's subwoofer handled explosions well, and dialogue sounded crisp and clear, too. 

Listening to music is also an enjoyable experience with this speaker. If I didn't know the price tag beforehand, I would've guessed this speaker is far more expensive. You can't go wrong with the Polk Audio T50.  

## [Yamaha NS-F210​BL (Single)](https://amzn.to/2M8U204){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M8U204"><img alt="Yamaha NS-F210​ (Single)" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/tower-speaker/yamaha-ns-f210.jpg" /></a>

The [Yamaha NS-F210​BL](https://amzn.to/2M8U204){: target="_blank"} sounds highly detailed and crisp. Vocals project well, and stereo imagery is also stable. 

Speed between mids and highs is easily audible, and the speaker has good overall midrange sound quality. 

I had to turn up the base settings considerably to hear any substantial lows, probably due to the speaker's slim cabinets and tiny drivers. 

The speaker's surround sound is phenomenal – in fact, it may be the speaker's strongest quality. The NS-C210 centre speaker – despite its small size – provides sufficient weight and definition to voices and other midrange sounds. 

The speaker also has plenty of rear ambience, thanks to the NS-B210 at the other end. 

Although it has a relatively low price tag, this speaker can hold its own, especially after you tweak some settings. 

## [Onkyo SKF-4800​ (Pair)](https://amzn.to/2M0bIuE){: target="_blank"} 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M0bIuE"><img alt="Onkyo SKF-4800" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/tower-speaker/onkyo-skf-4800.jpg " /></a>

The [Onkyo SKF-4800​](https://amzn.to/2M0bIuE){: target="_blank"} is one of the best floor standing speakers for your money. Its one-inch soft dome tweeter radiates lovely high-frequency sound that accompany the speaker's amazing base. 

Onkyo produces amazing products for those on a budget. Rather than a mid-level sound bar or home theater system, you can couple this speaker set with an Onkyo receiver to create an awesome surround sound system. 

The speakers are rated for 55Hz on the low end, but you won't need a subwoofer, as these speakers have impactful base. Overall, you can't go wrong with Onkyo's SKF-4800, especially considering its price. 

This set of speakers is easily one of the best you'll find below $500.
