### The Processor 
![i3-7100](/img/cpu/i3.png "Intel Core i3-7100"){: .img-medium .img-right}
The processor, though important, isn't nearly as important as the <a href="600gpu">gpu</a>. This means we can save some money on the processor and use it for the gpu. 

As long as the processor does not [bottleneck](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1683595/detect-cpu-bottleneck.html) the gpu. 

The [Intel i3-7100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCESRJX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NCESRJX&linkId=fac1805aac3fc25a5d6e98b6b2469e48) is a great choice for this build. 

Though the Ryzen 5 1400 was desired, the i3-7100 fit the budget well, primarily due to the increase in GPU prices (Ethereum mining has driven GPU prices through the roof!). [For more on Ethereum mining, click here.](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/)

The i3-7100 is new from Intel, and makes a great CPU for gaming on a budget. Keeping up with mid-range graphics cards, the i3-7100 won't bottleneck, or lag behind. 

Sporting two physical cores, this processor also is hyperthreaded, meaning each core has two threads. 

Due to hyperthreading technology, this processor has two physical AND two theoretical cores, rendering it a quad-core processor. 

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: LGA1151
* Operating Frequency: 3.9GHz 
* Cores: 2
* Lithography: 14nm
* TDP: 51 Watts
* Hyperthreading Technology: Yes
* Integrated Graphics: Intel HD 630

This processor is cheap and effective.

### The Motherboard
![ASRock B250M HDV](/img/mobo/asrock-b250m-hdv.png "ASRock B250M HDV"){: .img-medium .img-right}
Finding the right motherboard is important, as is any other part in a gaming PC. However, there may be more to consider than you're aware of. 

Things like PCI slots, chipsets, socket types, ram support/speed, etc. That being said, the cheapest motherboard may not be the best choice. 

Since the i3-7100 is being used, 2400 MHz ram is optimal to boost the performance of the processor. 

This is why the [ASRock B250M HDV MicroATX Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9BY912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N9BY912&linkId=6b6b6e19af89dfba6b3f388ed0e6834c) was chosen for this PC. 

The micro-ATX form factor is fitting for this "stealth" build, and it supports 2400 MHz ram due to its B250 chipset. 

Specs:

* Socket Type: LGA1151
* Chipset: Intel B250
* Memory Slots: 2x 288-pin DIMM
* Memory Type: DDR4-2133/2400
* Max Supported Memory: 32GB
* Sata 6 GB/s: 6
* Onboard USB 3.0 Headers: Yes
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps

This motherboard has all of the necessary components, all packed nicely into a micro-ATX form factor.
