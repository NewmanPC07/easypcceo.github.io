## $600 Build Guide

### The Case
![Cuboid-r1](/img/case/cuboid-r1.jpg "Cuboid R1"){: .img-medium .img-right}

* Type: MicroATX Mini Tower
* Color: Black/Red 
* External 5.25" Bays: 1
* Internal 2.5" Bays: 2
* Internal 3.5" Bays: 3

### The Processor 
![i3-7100](/img/cpu/i3.png "Intel Core i3-7100"){: .img-medium .img-right}
The processor, though important, isn't nearly as important as the <a href="#600gpu">gpu</a>. This means we can save some money on the processor and use it for the gpu. 

As long as the processor does not [bottleneck](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1683595/detect-cpu-bottleneck.html) the gpu. 

The [Intel i3-7100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCESRJX/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01NCESRJX&linkId=fac1805aac3fc25a5d6e98b6b2469e48) is a great choice for this build. 

Though the Ryzen 5 1400 was desired, the i3-7100 fit the budget well, primarily due to the increase in GPU prices (Ethereum mining has driven GPU prices through the roof!). [For more on Ethereum mining, click here.](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/)

The i3-7100 is new from Intel, and makes a great CPU for gaming on a budget. Keeping up with mid-range graphics cards, the i3-7100 won't bottleneck, or lag behind. 

Sporting two physical cores, this processor also is hyperthreaded, meaning each core has two threads. 

Due to hyperthreading technology, this processor has two physical AND two theoretical cores, rendering it a quad-core processor. 

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: LGA1151
* Operating Frequency: 3.9GHz 
* Cores: 2
* Lithography: 14nm
* TDP: 51 Watts
* Hyperthreading Technology: Yes
* Integrated Graphics: Intel HD 630

This processor is cheap and effective.

### The Motherboard
![ASRock B250M HDV](/img/mobo/asrock-b250m-hdv.png "ASRock B250M HDV"){: .img-medium .img-right}
Finding the right motherboard is important, as is any other part in a gaming PC. However, there may be more to consider than you're aware of. 

Things like PCI slots, chipsets, socket types, ram support/speed, etc. That being said, the cheapest motherboard may not be the best choice. 

Since the i3-7100 is being used, 2400 MHz ram is optimal to boost the performance of the processor. 

This is why the [ASRock B250M HDV MicroATX Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9BY912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N9BY912&linkId=6b6b6e19af89dfba6b3f388ed0e6834c) was chosen for this PC. 

The micro-ATX form factor is fitting for this "stealth" build, and it supports 2400 MHz ram due to its B250 chipset. 

Specs:

* Socket Type: LGA1151
* Chipset: Intel B250
* Memory Slots: 2x 288-pin DIMM
* Memory Type: DDR4-2133/2400
* Max Supported Memory: 32GB
* Sata 6 GB/s: 6
* Onboard USB 3.0 Headers: Yes
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps

This motherboard has all of the necessary components, all packed nicely into a micro-ATX form factor.

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-medium .img-right}

Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming today, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the B250 chipset of the motherboard, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

### The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png  "1TB Hard Drive"){: .img-medium .img-right}

The [WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&linkId=ebd1ec7b7b862a7d17070d2b1ea21b01) is today's standard mass storage drive for good reason. 

1TB of storage is plenty for your OS, drivers, video games, music, videos, etc. Furthermore, this HDD is known for its reliability and dependibility. 

It is a 7200 RPM hard drive, meaning load times are signficantly quicker than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Unfortunately we were not able to include an SSD in this build. However, you can find SSDs on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=solid+state+drive&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) at a low cost.

### The Graphics Card 
![GTX 1060 3GB](/img/gpu/gtx-1060-dual.png "GTX 1060 3GB"){: .img-right .img-medium}

The GPU is probably the most important part of a gaming PC. It handles all of the 3D rendering. In the case of [crypto mining](/crypto-mining/), the GPU does all of the heavy lifting. 

In this build, the [GTX 1060 3GB Dual-Fan GPU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KMVHB6M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01KMVHB6M&linkId=aec81717edcff45b3aeba975cf39c359) was chosen. It was hard to fit this GPU in the budget due to the spike in GPU pricing recently, but we made it happen.

The GTX 1060 3GB does well in nearly all titles, even in 1080P. Much like other Pascal GPUs, the 1060 increases clock speeds relative to the previous generation. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
* Memory Size: 3GB
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Core Clock: 1.59GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.81GHz
* TDP: 120 Watts
* Length: 9.53"

This GPU/CPU combo boasts 60fps at max settings in games like GTA V, The Witcher 3, Battlefield 1, Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, and many more titles.

### The Power Supply
![EVGA 450 Watt](/img/PSU/450.jpg "EVGA 450 Watt"){: .img-medium .img-right}


As PC parts become ever more efficient, the total power consumption of a PC build lowers. This "stealth" build only uses 256 watts. 

The [EVGA 450 watt power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F5LX55K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01F5LX55K&linkId=b4024f6293eca89ef2d4d4d1591445a9) was chosen for the build. It has an 80+ bronze power efficiency certification. 

Though it is not modular, the case in this build allows for proper cable management. 

Specs:

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 450 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: No
* Efficiency Certification: 80+ Bronze
* Efficiency: >85% 
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 2
