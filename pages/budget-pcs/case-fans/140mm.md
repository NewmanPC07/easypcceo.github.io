After testing more than 8 fans, we've concluded that the Corsair Air Series AF140 Quiet Edition (QE) is the best 140mm case fan for your money in 2018. 

140mm case fans are capable of pushing more air than smaller case fans when spinning at the same speed thanks to their blades' greater surface area. 

Although some [small cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/) are not capable of housing large 140mm case fans, if you have an ATX case, it's more than likely compatible. 

Otherwise, if you're using a smaller Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX case, you may want to consider a [120mm case fan](/budget-pcs/case-fans/120mm/) or, smaller still, an [80mm case fan](/budget-pcs/case-fans/80mm/).

The Corsair AF140 QE delivers high airflow while remaining quiet and efficient. This low-noise case fan has striking LED lights and translucent blades with a frosted texture, resulting in a stunning lighting effect during operation. It's the perfect compliment to any gaming setup. 

As far as performance is concerned, the AF140 QE cooling capability is exemplary. The fan needs at least 3cm of mounting clearance, and performs best when used as an exhaust fan, mounted near the rear or the top of your case. Likewise, they can also be used as intake fans mounted near the side panel or bottom air intakes. If you're interested in cooling highly obstructed areas such as hard drive cages or other tight spaces, you're better off purchasing a fan with high CFM as opposed to high airflow. 
 
The AF140 outperforms other standard 140mm case fans, as the blades are custom-molded for optimal airflow and performance. The blades are also ultra-thin to reduce noise, and lastly, the sleeve bearing coupled with the fan's padded corners work together to minimize vibration noise. 

## Packaging & Contents 

The AF140 QE ships in a red and black box which has a clear plastic panel displaying the fan on the left side, a red strip with the fan's name on the right side of the box, in addition to its speed and noise level. Lastly, there is a three year warranty icon at the bottom left. 

The back of the box has a full spec chart that covers everything you need to know about the fan, and there's a small blurb about what makes the AF140 QE a unqiue case fan. 

Also inside the box you'll find a bag containing a set of four screws to mount the case fan, in addition to a step-down resistor used to underpower the fan, decreasing the voltage from 12V to 7V.
