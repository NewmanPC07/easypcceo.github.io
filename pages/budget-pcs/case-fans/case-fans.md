**Here's the deal:**

Case fans play a crucial role in your PC – without them, your components will [overheat](https://www.howtogeek.com/174288/how-to-tell-if-your-computer-is-overheating-and-what-to-do-about-it/){: target="_blank"} and become damaged or worse, destroyed. 

With that being said, you should choose your next set of pc fans carefully. 

The best case fans need to be quiet, efficient, and of course, they have to provide great airflow. 

Well, it looks like you're in luck. 

Why?

I've procured the 13 best case fans in 2018, from 80mm case fans all the way up to 140mm case fans.

## Case Fan Buying Guide

Before you buy your next set of case fans, it's important to consider the following:

* **Size** – The size of your fans matter. The most commonly used case fan sizes are 80mm, 120mm, and 140mm. If possible, buy 140mm case fans, as they provide the best airflow at lower RPMs (since they're the biggest, they push more air at the same RPM as a smaller fan.)

* **Noise** – If you're anything like me, noisy case fans drive you insane. Noise level is especially important if you want to make YouTube videos or stream to Twitch. You definitely don't want noisy case fans, so pay close attention to your fan's [dBa](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/A-weighted-decibels-dBA-or-dBa-or-dBa){: target="_blank"} noise level. 

* **Airflow** – This one is obvious, so I'm not going to go into detail about it – just make sure your fans provide adequate airflow.

* **Type of Power Connector** - Fans that connect to the motherboard usually have 2 Pins. The 3 Pin fans have a tachometer signal that allows the motherboard to read the fan’s RPMs, and the 4 Pin connector fans have PWM signal for speed control. Also, make sure your motherboard has enough fan connectors to accommodate all of your fans. 

* **Cosmetics** – Lastly, you'll want to make sure your fans look cool! There are many different designs to choose from. Don't be afraid to search until you find the right fans for you. 

## Best PC Fan for Gaming 

Although some companies advertise their fans as 'gaming fans,' they aren't any different from regular fans. 

I'd recommend choosing one of the fans listed above, either 120mm or 140mm in size, because they are the best PC case fans money can buy. 

If you want, choose fans that come with LEDs, as that's really the only difference between regular case fans and 'gaming fans.' 

## How to Install Case Fans 

<div class="vid-container">

</div>

## The Importance of Case Fans 

Case fans are important because the components inside your PC generate *a lot* of heat. If you didn't have a CPU cooler on your CPU, for example, you could fry an egg on top of it. Seriously, look it up. 

If your components get too hot, it can damage them and shorten their lifespan. You'll run into problems with your components malfunctioning if they get too hot. 

Most components are programmed to automatically shut down if they get too hot to avoid damage. So, either your PC will turn off over and over, or your components will be damaged. 

CPUs and GPUs run especially hot – it is crucial that your PC draws in cool air and expels the warm air. 

An efficient cooling system can increase the performance and the lifespan of your computer.

## 120mm Case Fans vs. 140mm Case Fans 

So, if you have the option to choose either 120mm or 140mm case fans, which is best? 

In almost every scenario, you should choose 140mm case fans. 

**Here's why:**

140mm fans are larger than 120mm fans (obviously). Therefore, they can move more air, even at a lower RPM. They can spin slower (and more quietly), while achieving the same cooling. 

Or, you can have them spin faster and produce even more air. 

The only time you should use 120mm case fans over 140mm is if your case can hold more 120mm fans than 140mm fans. 

Cases that have space for a 240mm radiator are also an exception – in that case, it'd be wise to mount two 120mm case fans.

Noctua has delivered yet another superb case fan – despite its small size, their 80mm [NF-A8 FLX](https://amzn.to/2qU4jRf){: target="_blank"} is capable of outputting nearly 30 [CFM](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CFM.html){: target="_blank"}. This highly optimised premium case fan is reliable, cheap, and most important of all, effective.

Considering its small form factor, this fan's cooling potential is impressive to say the least.

Featuring Noctua’s [AAO](https://noctua.at/en/aao-frame){: target="_blank"} (Advanced Acoustic Optimisation) frame and flow acceleration channels to further improve the fan’s quiet cooling performance, this award-winning 80mm case fan has it all. You can choose between 2000/1650/1200 RPM speed settings via the fan’s included Low-Noise adaptors, giving you the flexibility to configure your fan exactly as you need, and balancing thermal performance and acoustic performance. 

It has an SSO2 bearing to ensure a long lifespan, backed by Noctua's 6 year manufacturer's warranty. The Noctua NF-A8's predecessor, the NF-R8, has become a default-choice among PC builders looking for a quiet case fan that still packs a punch. The NF-A8 provides even higher static pressure and a superior noise/airflow ratio than its predecessor, thanks to aerodynamic optimisations.

Cooler Master's 80mm sleeve bearing case fan is well known for its quiet operation, even when running at top speed. It does not have any fancy features or flashly LED lights – rather, its performance does the talking.

This entry level case fan has black blades, and a black enclosure. The most noteable feature is the large holographic logo in the center of the fan. 

If you're someone bothered by background noise, this 80mm case fan is for you. For the price of less than $10, this case fan is an absolute steal. They're simple to install, reliable, and effective. 

Despite the fan's small size, it outputs 24.2 cubic feet per minute of air output, which is above and beyond the call of duty of an 80mm case fan. 

It's specifically designed for use with Cooler Master's CM 690, 590, and 690 II cases which have special cooling slots designed for high airflow. Nevertheless, this fan can be used in any case that supports 80mm fans. 

Unfortunately, the fan does not have a [PWM](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/glossary/definitions.mvp/term/Fan%20Controller%20-%20PWM/gpk/832){: target="_blank"} feature, which is a bit disappointing – on the other hand, it is incredibly cheap and, for the money, it does a great job. It's a basic case fan built to withstand the test of time. All in all, the Cooler Master 80mm sleeve bearing silent fan is simple, dependable, and best of all, it's cheap!

Last but certainly not least, Antec's [TriCool 80mm DBB](https://amzn.to/2Q8K14P){: target="_blank"} case fan packs in as much performance as possible for less than $15. Featuring 3 adjustable speed settings, nearly silent operation even at full blast, and optional LED lighting, this cheap case fan is great for the money.

The Antec TriCool 80mm DBB comes in a clear plastic design, but variants of the fan can be purchased with LED lighting installed to give your case a bit of extra personality. Pushing a maximum of 34 CFM, this tiny case fan punches above its weight class. It's best used as either an inlet fan or an accessory fan to an existing cooling system. 

The fan is nearly silent – it does not rattle during operation, and it is well balanced. You have the option to adjust the amount of air this little guy pushes based on your needs, which is always an awesome feature. Even when the fan is on its lowest speed, airflow is perfectly adequate to cool most systems. 

People have nothing but good things to say about this fan across the web, and for good reason.

The ARCTIC F12 PWM PST case fan was designed to run as quietly as possible while facilitating airflow and ventilation. Best of all, you can buy five of these premium fans on Amazon for less than $30.

Arctic's PWM fans are a bit different than traditional PWM fans. Thanks to Arctic's patented PST (PWM Sharing Technology), the PST feature allows up to five of these case fans to be chained together. If you adjust the speed of one of the fans, you'll adjust the speed of all of the fans. This handy feature ensures stable temperatures at the lowest possible fan speed, thus reducing noise. The fan is also reversible – in other words, you can install it in a manner that will either draw cool air into your case (intake) or push warm air out of your case (exhaust).  

The fan's housing is unique in that it is comprised of two seperate sections, which are connected via rubber grommets in the corners of the fan. The rubber corners help to suppress noise from vibrations. The Arctic F12 PWM performs incredibly well under load, boasting both great airflow and static pressure. It's important to note that, thanks to the fan's unique design, it is thicker than traditional 120mm case fans, which may lead to compatibility issues if you have a [small case](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/).

The F12 definitely does not disappoint when it comes to bang for your buck. All in all, this fan performs well and runs quietly, all for a modest price – what more could you ask for?

Noctua is making another appearance on this list, and for good reason. The Noctua NF-F12 is the 120mm variant of their NF-A8. Just like this fan's 80mm little brother, both the NF-F12's acoustic and thermal performance are exemplary.

Although this fan may look plain, it is actually far from it. The fan is designed with Noctua's [Focused Flow](https://noctua.at/en/focused-flowtm-frame){: target="_blank"} frame to achieve the perfect balance between cooling performance and quietness. 

There are eleven stator guide vanes at the back of the NF-F12 that are positioned with different angular distances. The fan also features Vortex Control Notches which help to spread the noise emission over a broader frequency spectrum, in turn making the fan's sound pattern more appealing to the ear. 

The NF-F12 uses an SSO2 bearing, built entirely with brass to ensure a long lifespan, and the rear magnet has been moved closer to the axis to deliver increased stability during operation. Despite this fan's affordable price, it is one of Noctua's high-performance fans, guaranteed to deliver fantastic airflow without making a lot of noise.

As the fan's name would imply, this case fan is nearly silent during regular use, and it's still impressively quiet when rotating at full speed. The Silentwings3 has seven PWM fan blades with an optimized surface structure to ensure excellent airflow.

This fan also has anti-vibration mountings that reduce the level of noise from vibrations. The fan's advanced fluid-dynamic bearing is rated to have a 300,000 hour life span, and the fan ships with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty. It's safe to say Be Quiet! is confident in their product's reliability.

Similarly to a MagLev bullet train which levitates above the tracks, the Corsair ML120 PRO LED fan uses magnetic levitation to suspend the fan blades from the motor housing. This provides a (nearly) friction-less operation, which results in less noise and better performance.

This fan looks absolutely awesome, and performs well too. You can choose between different colored LEDS, including blue, red, white, and black. Moreover, its unique magnetic bearing is quiet and efficient. Overall, you can't go wrong with this case fan. The fan's vibrant LED lighting is perfect for any gaming setup.

Spinning at 1200 RPM and only emitting 25.5 dBa, the AF140 is capable of regulating your PC's internal temperature without making too much noise. It's rated at 66.4 CFM, and Corsair recommends at least 3cm of clearance between the fan and anything else inside your case to ensure the best possible airflow. 

Corsair's advanced hydraulic bearing engine design is clever. They took the common sleeve bearing design and improved it to rival the reliability of a high end product. Sleeve bearings are known to emit less noise than fans with ball bearings, but their lack of lubrication usually means they have significantly shorter life spans.

If I had to describe this case fan with one word, it would be performance. This case fan can cool even the hottest computers and it's guarunteed to last, all for an affordably low price.

This fan features anti-vibration pads on each corner to dampen vibrations, and redesigned thicker fan blades to provide more reliability. This fan's thermal and acoustic performance are both exemplary. They're a great fit for beginner and experienced builders alike.

The Corsair Ml140 is the 140mm version of the ML120. If you like the ML120's vibrant LED lighting but you want a bigger case fan, the ML140 is a great option for you. It also has the same magnetic bearing as the ML120 – needless to say, its thermal performance is exemplary.

You can dynamically control the fan's speed from 400 RPM all the way up to 2000 RPM to minimize noise or maximize airflow. I use these case fans in my PC, and I've never had any issues. They might work a bit too well!

## Conclusion

If you take away anything from this article, it should be the following:

*Whatever you do, buy case fans!* If your computer gets too hot, you'll damage your oh so expensive components. 

Additionally, you can choose case fans that match your PC's color scheme. They're a great way to show your personality.
