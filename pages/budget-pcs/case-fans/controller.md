## Best Fan Controller Options 

When it comes to cooling your PC, choosing the right [case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/) is crucial. 

Not only are they responsible for cooling your components, they also have to be quiet during operation! 

Some case fans have a PWM function which allows you to control their speed – however, this is usually only the case for premium (and more expensive) case fans. 

Moreover, what if you want to daisy-chain your fans together, controlling all of their speeds at the same time? 

That's where a fan controller comes in. With the [NZXT Sentry 3](https://amzn.to/2LqplAr){: target="_blank"}, you can daisy-chain up to five case fans together, allowing you to control all of them at once. Conversely, you can also hook each fan up to its own channel, controlling each individually. 

In any event, here are the three best fan controllers of 2018:

This fan controller ships with an included temperature sensor which can be mounted anywhere in the case. You can choose between controlling the fan speeds manually, or letting them adjust themselves automatically based on the case's internal temperature. This is the best way to minimize noise, as your fans won't spin faster than they need to.

Unfortunately, this fan controller only supports 3-pin fan headers. However, it does allow you to control the speed of all of the 3-pin fans that otherwise would not have a PWM function. It doesn't have any fancy features or crazy software, but it's also less than $20. If you're on a budget, this fan controller gets the job done – it's simple, reliable, and best of all, it's cheap. 

## What is a Fan Controller?

A fan controller is a device used to manage the rotational speed of a PC case fan. Various types of case fans are used to provide adequate cooling to components, some of which without the ability to regulate their own speed. 

Fan controllers are used to – either manually or automatically – case fans' speed according to temperature and noise production. 

However, not all case fan controllers were created equally. Some are loaded with plenty of awesome features, modes, and connections, whereas others are barebones controllers without even an interface. 

You can find internal fan controllers and external fan controllers. External fan controllers like the NZXT Sentry 3 can be mounted in your case's 5.25-inch drive bay and controlled via a physical interface. The Sentry 3 has a nice touch screen that allows you to easily adjust your fans' speed, and you can link them together too. 

Internal fan controllers, on the other hand, live inside of your case. After connecting them to your motherboard, you can adjust your fans' speed via your fan controller software. I personally prefer external fan controllers that allow you to physically adjust fan speed, but that's just my opinion.

With all of these different options, which fan controller is best for you? Do you even need a fan controller? 

At least when it comes to your case fans, a fan controller isn't entirely necesary. Your case fans have to constantly circulate a stream of cool air to your components. If they're doing so while running at the same preset speed, they'll do just fine. 

Nevertheless, running your fans at the same speed at all times is not the best way to cool your PC – by adjusting your fans' speed according to temperature, you'll save electricity while simultaneously reducing noise. There's no point in having them run at full speed at all times, even when you're not performing intensive operations. 

Being able to control the speed of your fans, either with fan controller software or via a physical interface, is always nice. Fan controllers don't have to break the bank either. Of course, there are expensive, premium fan controllers on the market, but you can easily find a cheap fan controller that gets the job done for less than $20.

## Things to Keep in Mind 

With so many different fan controllers available, each with their own features and specifications, it can be difficult to know which is best for you. Some may not even know if a fan controller is compatible with their system. 

Don't worry – if you keep the following things in mind, you'll make the right choice: 

**Speed control options:** Fan speed is controlled by adjusting the fan's voltage. Figure out how the fan controller adjusts speed. Does it only allow you to choose between a few settings? Can you choose any rotational speed from 0 RPM to the fan's maximum rotation speed? Both of are questions you should be asking before you buy a fan controller. You should make a decision based on your own specific needs. It's also important to remember that faster rotation speeds result in more wear and tear and, as a consequence, a shorter lifespan. Fan lifespan is not determined by speed alone; a fan's bearing type and build quality has the most significant impact on lifespan. 

**Compatibility:** A good fan controller should be compatible with different operating systems. Ideally, a fan controller is compatible with 3-pin and 4-pin fan connectors, although most budget fan controllers are only compatible with 3-pin connectors. By the way, 4-pin fan connectors have a PWM feature, whereas 3-pin connectors don't. Supporting the wrong type of fan connector is the biggest fan controller compatibility issue, so make sure your fan controller of choice supports 4-pin fan connectors if you have PWM case fans.

<figcaption><p>Pictured above is an internal fan controller. It doesn't have a manual UI – instead, you adjust fan speed with fan controller software on your computer. Notice that this fan controller also only has 3-pin fan connectors, as opposed to supporting 4-pin fan headers as well.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

**Temperature monitoring:** Many premium fan controllers these days can automatically adjust fan speed by monitoring the system temperature. Automatic fan controllers save electricity and reduce noise by running your fans at the appropriate speed at all times. It's an awesome feature, but not all fan controllers have it. 

**External or internal:** Some fan controllers are external – they can be mounted in the case's 5.25-inch drive bay or outside of the case altogether. They usually have a user interface like a touch screen, control knobs, or buttons. On the other hand, internal fan controllers live inside of the case and are controlled with fan controller software on your computer. At the end of the day, choosing between an internal or external fan controller comes down to a matter of personal preference. Some popular case manufacturers are starting to remove 5.25-inch drive bays from their cases altogether, especially in smaller Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX cases. Even some [small ATX cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/) don't have 5.25-inch bays anymore. With that being said, if you buy a fan controller like the NZXT Sentry 3 that's mounted in a 5.25-inch bay, you need to make sure your case actually has one first.
