## The PST Feature Explained 

Graphics cards and processors generate a lot of heat, especially when overclocked – believe it or not, if it weren't for the CPU cooler, you could fry an egg on top of your CPU! 

Needless to say, running your CPU and GPU at full blast leads to high ambient case temperatures. Most people think using more case fans is the best way to cool their case. Unfortunately, using a bunch of case fans produces more noise and consumes more electricity. 

Arctic's new PWM fan alleviates this issue without the hassle, noise, and wasted electricity. Through the use of the motherboard's BIOS, the fan's automatically change their speed according to the system's temperature. Moreover, Arctic's PST function allows up to five fans (yes, including the CPU fan) to be daisy-chained together. All of the fans in the system will operate in unison, controlled by a single Arctic F12 case fan. 

When the case's internal temperature rises, the fans will speed up. Conversely, when your rig isn't under heavy load and temperatures drop, your case fans' speed will lower as well. In summary, the PST feature minimizes noise and electricity consumption while still ensuring your case maintains a stable temperature, regardless of your computer's stress level.
