### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-medium .img-right}
A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

Some games depend heavily on the CPU (though these games are poorly optimized), a fast CPU is necesssary for good performance. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5) is a great budget gaming CPU. It holds its own in CPU intensive games such as Arma and ARK Survival, while also keeping up with high end GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1070.

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz

In the past few years, Intel has been the choice for nearly all gamers. In recent months, AMD has come out with a new line of processors: Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5. 

While Ryzen 7 is a bit overkill most gamers, the Ryzen 5 line is an outstanding choice. The price to performance from a Ryzen 5 processor is absolutely unbelievable. In fact, they often outperform many of Intel's CPUs.
