<font color="red">NOTE: GPU & RAM prices are soaring sky high, and some of the components below may be overpriced because of this. Prebuilt gaming PCs are still cheap and they're a great way to save money if you're looking to get into the PC gaming community. Check out our guide on <a href="/budget-pcs/prebuilt/">prebuilt gaming PCs</a>! Otherwise, you're going to overspend on parts that you could get for a lower price.</font>

## A Prebuilt Gaming PC under $800 - The [HP Pavillion Power Premium Gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2BRguS5){:target="_blank"} 
<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BRguS5"><img alt="$800 prebuilt gaming PC" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/prebuilt/800.png" /></a>


I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across the [Newest Flagship HP Pavilion Power Premium Gaming VR Ready Desktop](http://amzn.to/2BRguS5){:target="_blank"} gaming PC on Amazon for only $800. It has an AMD Radeon RX 580 which would cost you around $550 alone. 

Not only are you getting an amazing deal on the GPU, you're getting an amazing deal on the entire PC. *If you tried to build this PC yourself, it could cost you over $1,100.* This is easily the best value for the money of all the PCs on this list. 

The Ryzen 5 1400 is an outsanding chip which will have no problem handling 1080p gaming with the RX 580. In fact, this PC could even handle some VR gaming if you're interested in experiencing it. 

Furthermore, this PC not only features a 1TB mass storage drive, but a 256 GB SSD. This is awesome! When you load your Windows OS, drivers, and a few games on the SSD, the computer will operate much more quickly than if these files were stored on the mechanical hard drive. 

The computer even comes with a copy of Windows 10 already installed. Overall, this PC is an absolute steal.

## The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-small .img-right}
A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

Some games depend heavily on the CPU (though these games are poorly optimized), a fast CPU is necesssary for good performance. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://amzn.to/2NAjtVk) is a great budget gaming CPU. It holds its own in CPU intensive games such as Arma and ARK Survival, while also keeping up with high end GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1070.
Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Cores: 4
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (8 Threads)

In the past few years, Intel has been the choice for nearly all gamers. In recent months, AMD has come out with a new line of processors: Ryzen 7, 5 and 3.

While Ryzen 7 is a bit overkill for most gamers, the Ryzen 5 line is an outstanding choice. The price to performance from a Ryzen 5 processor is absolutely unbelievable. In fact, they often outperform many of Intel's CPUs.

## The Motherboard 
![ASRock AB350M-HDV](/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png){: .img-right .img-small}


The [ASRock - AB350M-HDV Micro ATX AM4 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWC7BTJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06WWC7BTJ&linkId=cdb80c48b66448e67ac40c42cdb7391a) was chosen for this build. 

For the price of just $60, you are getting a great deal. Not only is it sturdy and reliable, it supports 2400 MHz ram. 

What's the bottom line here? 

Not only are you getting a superb motherboard, you're getting it for less than $70. 

**Specs:**

* Socket - AM4
* Chipset - AMD B350
* Memory - DDR4 2133/2400/2666/2933/3000
* Memory Channel - Dual
* DIMM Slots - 2x288-pin DIMM
* Max Memory (GB) - 32

## The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://amzn.to/2uRwLVK) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B250 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

## The Solid State Drive
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NByF4z"><img class="img-small img-right" src="/img/hdd/sandisk-240.png" /> </a>

This build is sporting the [SanDisk - SSD PLUS 240GB 2.5" Solid State Drive](https://amzn.to/2NByF4z){: target="_blank"}. The difference in speed and performance between a mechanical drive and a solid state drive is light and day – installing your OS, drivers, and games on your SSD will transform for PC from average to extrodinary. 

Have you ever felt like you had to wait for your computer to 'warm-up'? If so, you probably have a mechanical drive. Upgrading to an SSD will provide lightning fast loading speeds. 

SSD's are a bit pricier than mechanical drives in terms of $/GB of storage. A mechanical drive is cheaper, but not the best choice. 

Unfortunately, the mechanical drive was left out of the budget. Instead, you'll have 240GB of fast storage, plenty for your OS, drivers, and some games. 

You can always add a [1TB mechanical hard drive](https://amzn.to/2GUENTa) for an extra $50.

## The Graphics Card 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2NyBRO9"><img class="img-right img-small" src="/img/gpu/rx-580-pulse.png" /></a>

A graph most important part of any gaming PC is easily the graphics card. It handles all of the 3D rendering, and any well optimized game will utilize the GPU's power. 

For this build, the [Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Pulse (8GB)](https://amzn.to/2NyBRO9){: target="_blank"} was chosen. It saw a significant decrease in price recently, finally falling below the 500 dollar mark. 

Cryptocurrency mining has driven the prices of GPUs through the roof – it's been hard to find a good deal recently. This sub-$450 GPU can handle all new titles in 1080p with high and ultra settings. 

In addition, it is a great value, especially considering the prices of other graphics cards of that standard. 

This GPU is an excellent choice for 1440p and 1080p gaming. It can handle all of the newest titles maxed out with 60+ FPS.

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: Radeon RX 580 
* Memory Size: 8GB
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Core Clock: 1.26 GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.37 GHz
* TDP: 225 Watts
* Fan: Yes
* Length: 9.06" 
* DVI-D Dual-Link: 1
* Displayport: 2
* HDMI: 2

## The Power Supply 
![EVGA 400W PSU](/img/PSU/evga 400w.png "EVGA 400W PSU"){: .img-small .img-right}


The reliability of your power supply is important. Furthermore, it is crucial to use a power supply with the proper wattage. 

Why? 

If you fail to do either of these two things, one or both of the following will happen: 

A) Your power supply will short out your PC <br>    
B) Your power supply will fail completely 

This build is rated at 211 watts. That being said, the EVGA 400W ATX power supply is the choice for this build. 

It has more than enough power, and combined with its $30 price tag, it is an absolute steal. 

Specs: 

* Type - ATX
* Wattage - 400 Watts
* Fans - 1
* Modular - No 
* Efficiency - 80+ 
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors - 1
* PCI-Express 6-Pin Connectsors - 1  

If you plan on overclocking your CPU, consider buying a [more powerful PSU](https://amzn.to/2GBwXAh){: target="_blank"}. 

[Buy your power supply here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LV8TZAG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LV8TZAG&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=ad7cc6ba7d2b29a2ac59c043de411ad7){: .big-button}

## The Monster
<a href="http://amzn.to/2ywq5QS"><img class="img-middle" src="/img/case/nzxt-s340-black.png" /></a>

The Monster is the best gaming PC build for the moeny in 2018. You're getting an $800 budget gaming PC for a great value. 

Getting the most bang for your PC gaming buck is important – that's why the Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core processor was chosen. It's a great CPU with multi-threading, rendering it a champion of multitasking. 

Coupled with the Radeon RX 580, this custom gaming rig is an absolute beast, hence the name. We're in the midst of a GPU crisis – with that in mind, it's safe to say the price of the GPU is far more reasonable than other cards on the market. 

The Monster will boot up quickly – moreover, you'll be among the first in-game, all thanks to the speed of the SSD. 

You'll experience 60+ FPS in 1080p resolution in just about every game you play. In fact, you'll even be able to game in VR. 

If this build is a bit too expensive for you, check out our [$400](/budget-pcs/400/), [$500](/budget-pcs/500/), [$600](/budget-pcs/600/) and [$700](/budget-pcs/700/) gaming PC builds.

## The Monster ($800 PC) Perfromance Test

I imagine you want to see just how well this PC will perform. Here's a video of this computer playing 8 different games in 1080p with ultra settings:

## Do You Need an Expensive Processor for Gaming? 

In short, the answer is *no*, no you don't. 

Many people who are new to the PC gaming community are under the false impression that they have to shell out hundreds of dollars for a CPU. In reality, that is the furthest thing from the truth. 

When I attempted to create my first PC, I didn't really know what I was doing and I spent far too much money on the CPU, without really thinking about the GPU. [You don't need an expensive CPU for gaming](https://mygaming.co.za/news/hardware/119812-why-you-dont-need-an-expensive-processor-for-gaming.html){: target="_blank"}. 

Intel's marketing falsely advertises that gamers need "the power of an Intel i7" to play PC games. I'm running an overclocked Ryzen 3 1200, and it works perfectly fine. Pretty much any modern processor will suffice. Even a Pentium G4560 with hyperthreading will get the job done, as long as you pair it with the right video card.

GPUs (Video Cards) are designed to handle all of the 3D rendering. Any decent game developer will optimize their games to utilize the power of the GPU rather than the CPU. This means you can buy a fast GPU and worry about the CPU later. 

The only thing you have to watch out for when it comes to buying a CPU is ensuring that it won't bottleneck your GPU. This means you shouldn't pair a GTX 1080 Ti with an Intel i3. 

Since the CPU is the brain of your computer, it still has to process plenty of information when you're gaming – even though *most* of the work is done by the GPU, your CPU still plays a part. If your GPU is the fastest on the market, but your CPU is incredibly old and slow, the game will only perform as well as the CPU can handle. 

Fortunately, I've already selected the CPU/GPU combo for you, so you don't have to worry about it. In most cases, a CPU won't bottleneck the GPU.

## Extra Gaming Peripherals

The build above is a great start, but it's not everything you're going to need for the ultimate gaming setup. Eventually you'll need to buy a great gaming mouse, keyboard, headset, monitor, and more. 

**Gaming Keyboard -** Buying the right gaming keyboard is *very* important. Firstly, a poor or old gaming keyboard is going to put you at a disadvantage in-game. Moreover, you want a keyboard that's comfortable even after hours of gaming. 

You'll also want to think about the kind of keyboard you're buying. Traditional membrane keyboards feel mushy and less responsive than mechanical keyboards. Most gamers, myself included, own a mechanical gaming keyboard. They often provide the best wrist support, and they also have cool RGB LEDs that help to personalize your gaming PC. 

**Here are some popular gaming keyboards to consider:** 

* [Logitech G513](https://amzn.to/2J8FUlO){: target="_blank"} – $150 
* [Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2](https://amzn.to/2J8XxBR){: target="_blank"} – $130
* [Razer Cynosa Chroma](https://amzn.to/2LAeofc){: target="_blank"} – $60
* [HyperX Alloy Elite](https://amzn.to/2kr4Y9y){: target="_blank"} – $110

**Gaming Mouse -** Buying the right gaming mouse is also super important. If you're worried about switching from console controllers to PC's keyboard and mouse, I understand where you're coming from. I was a console gamer for six years before I switched, and it was hard at first.

However, buying the right gaming mouse helped me out tremendously. I use the [Razer Death Adder](https://amzn.to/2KXQnO6){: target="_blank"} – I've tried several different gaming mice and the Death Adder is my favorite. 

Gaming mice, as opposed to traditional mice, have superior tracking capabilities, adjustable DPI, and often come with cool RGB lights and more importantly, customizable macros. Macros (buttons on the side and the top of the mouse) can be programmed to perform certain actions in game (dodge, use a potion, activate microphone, switch weapons, etc.) that are incredibly convenient. 

**Here are some popular gaming mice to consider:** 

* [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2Lxizsg){: target="_blank"} – $53
* [Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2IQXSWC){: target="_blank"} – $50 
* [Logitech G703](https://amzn.to/2GSoNzr){: target="_blank"} – $100

**Gaming Headset -** Buying the right gaming headset is crucial. Believe it or not, hearing your opponents can give you vital information that can give you the competitive edge. 

Moreover, you're probably buying a gaming PC because of their superior graphics and performance – great surround sound quality is another important aspect to consider if you want to truly immersify yourself in the game you're playing.
