## Build Guide

### The Case 
![Cooler Master - Masterbox 5](/img/case/masterbox5.jpg "Cooler Master - Masterbox 5"){: .img-small .img-right}

### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-small .img-right}
A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

Some games depend heavily on the CPU (though these games are poorly optimized), a fast CPU is necesssary for good performance. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5) is a great budget gaming CPU. It holds its own in CPU intensive games such as Arma and ARK Survival, while also keeping up with high end GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1070.
Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Cores: 4
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (8 Threads)

In the past few years, Intel has been the choice for nearly all gamers. In recent months, AMD has come out with a new line of processors: Ryzen 7, 5 and 3.

While Ryzen 7 is a bit overkill for most gamers, the Ryzen 5 line is an outstanding choice. The price to performance from a Ryzen 5 processor is absolutely unbelievable. In fact, they often outperform many of Intel's CPUs.

### The Motherboard 
![MSI B350 PC Mate](/img/mobo/msi-b350-pcmate.png "MSI B350 PC Mate"){: .img-small .img-right}


The [MSI B350 PC MATE ATX AM4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVFFXXL/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06WVFFXXL&linkId=c7f83c2efe811aa13cdb56c3d188cad2) motherboard is an excellent choice for this build.

The B250 chipset allows for the use of 2400 MHz ram. Furthermore, it supports crossfire, leaving room for future upgrades.

The full ATX form factor also allows for future upgrades. This motherboard is reliable and trusted by many PC enthusiasts. 

While it doesn't have any extrodinary special features, it gets the job done. It's a great pick for the build, and an excellent motherboard for the price.

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B250 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

### The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png  "1TB Hard Drive"){: .img-small .img-right}


The [WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&linkId=ebd1ec7b7b862a7d17070d2b1ea21b01) is today's standard mass storage drive for good reason. 

1TB of storage is plenty for your OS, drivers, video games, music, videos, etc. Furthermore, this HDD is known for its reliability and dependibility. 

It is a 7200 RPM hard drive, meaning load times are signficantly quicker than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Unfortunately we were not able to include an SSD in this build. However, you can find SSDs on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=solid+state+drive&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) at a low cost.

### The Power Supply 
![Corsair CXM Series CX550M](/img/PSU/cx550m.png "Corsair CXM Series CX550M"){: .img-small .img-right}


Choosing the right power supply is more important than it may appear. If your power supply is not efficient, it will drive your electricity bill through the roof. If it's not powerful enough, your PC will short out. 

For this build, the [Corsair CXM Series CX550M 80+ bronze certified ATX power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B72W0A2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01B72W0A2&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=6d46f3fe50fb443290f260020e4e5aa6) was chosen. This PSU easily supplies sufficient wattage, as the estimated power consumption of this build is merely 351 watts. 

Its 80+ bronze certification will keep your electric bill low, and it is semi-modular as well, allowing for easy cable management. \

This not only looks pleasing to the eye, it also helps with air flow, which keeps your PC cool. 

Specs: 

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 550 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
