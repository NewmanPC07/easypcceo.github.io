For PC gamers on a low budget, we’ve got the best possible configurations for you to have an awesome experience at a price that won’t leave your wallet KIA. 

Some say it’s not possible to build a 400 dollar gaming PC, but we’ve proved them wrong. 

We've hand picked components for two different builds. 

On a tight budget like this, we recommend going with AMD, thanks to their Ryzen processors’ insane performance per dollar.

On the other hand, we know there are a lot of Team Blue (Intel) members out there, so we put together an alternate build using Intel parts instead. 

## Prebuilt Option

Before we talk about the custom builds, let's quickly talk about an awesome prebuilt gaming PC. 

It’s understandable: 

some people just don’t want to go through the trouble of painstakingly slapping together their PC from the ground up and installing Windows.

So, for the lazy ones, we have a prebuilt option to suit your $400 budget.

You’re going to want to add a dedicated graphics card if you’re serious about gaming with this PC. 

Adding a dedicated graphics card may push you over budget a bit. 

But why wouldn’t you – after all, you’re trying to game, right?

After the disaster that was FX series processors, AMD has bestowed upon us their Ryzen line. 

Offering amazing price to performance ratios, it’s quite difficult to beat what Ryzen is bringing to the table. Who knows, maybe Ryzen 3000 will even beat out it predecessors for the low-end market.

We were tempted to choose the Ryzen 3 2200G for this build for its 10% higher performance and integrated graphics, but its recent price increase from $69.99 to $87.99, unfortunately, pushed it quite a bit out of our budget.

With that being said, if you can spend the extra money (almost $20) for the 10% performance buff, you should. 

The Ryzen 3 1200 runs at a lower base and boost speed than the G5400, hitting a base of 3.1GHz and a boost of 2.4GHz, but it definitely makes up for it in its ability to overclock. 

The 1200 also boasts 4 physical cores against the G5400’s 2 physical cores, all of which are unlocked (you can overclock them).

Temperatures should be no issue as well, as the 1200 has a TDP (thermal design power) of just 65W. 

Alongside this low power consumption, the included Wraith Stealth cooler is one of the best stock coolers we’ve seen in a while and can even handle moderate overclocking.

Ryzen tends to run better with faster memory clocks, hence why we splurged the extra $5 on a 3000MHz kit with the hopes of overclocking. 

The 1200 is no exception, and you should be able to make great use of the overclocking abilities of both the RAM and CPU to get the best possible performance out of your rig.

<h2>Gigabyte B450M DS3H</h2>
<h3>Micro ATX Motherboard</h3>
<p>The Gigabyte B450M DS3H isn’t really much to write home about. It functions, you can overclock with it, and you have a headstart on your CPU upgrade path.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

The B450 chipset has out of the box support for the whole Ryzen 2000-series lineup, and can also support the upcoming 3000-series chips with a BIOS update. This means that you can easily upgrade to a 2200G, 2400G, 2600, or 2700 with no conflicts.

Since all Ryzen processors are unlocked, we strongly urge you to overclock your CPU and RAM to get the best possible performance out of your rig. This board also supports AMD Crossfire.

Its rear IO consists of 4 USB 2.0 ports, 4 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, and an RJ-45 Gigabit LAN port. For the front, it supports up to 4 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports via internal headers.

Storage is handled by 4 SATA III 6Gb/s connectors and 1 M.2 slot with SATA and PCIE 3.0 support. The B450M DS3H also comes with AMD StoreMI, a utility that offers SSD-like performance for traditionally sluggish mechanical hard drives.

This board is fairly baren when compared to other popular AM4 motherboards, but it’ll do what you need it to and it’ll do it well. 

At the end of the day, that’s all that matters, right?

<h2>Patriot Viper 4 8GB (2x4GB)</h2>
<h3>DDR4 3000MHz RAM</h3>
<p>The Patriot Viper 4 2x4GB kit rivals its similarly priced opponents with its 3000MHz of glory. Don’t be fooled – just because it’s relatively cheap, doesn’t mean it lags behind its competition.</p>

When it comes to AMD’s Ryzen CPUs, RAM speed matters – that's why 3000MHz RAM was chosen. 

Making use of its dual channel capabilities and its relatively high base clock, the Patriot Viper 4 is able to deliver steadfast performance before and after overclocking. 

This kit has been observed to be able to hit upwards of 3200MHz – not bad, huh?

Considering how memory hungry applications are becoming nowadays, we recommend upgrading to 16GB later down the line by adding another 2 x 4GB kit of the same model.

<h2>Seagate Constellation ES.3 1TB</h2>
<h3>7200RPM Mechanical Drive</h3>
<p>This Seagate Constellation 1TB mechanical hard drive doesn’t necessarily seem like anything special on the surface, but it actually provides a great deal of price to performance when compared to other similarly priced drives.</p>

Sporting the classification of “Enterprise,” this drive isn't a pushover. 

Built to last and efficient to boot, the Constellation will deliver exactly what you’re looking for: 

reliable mass storage at an affordable price.

Sitting at a price noticeably below the ever popular Western Digital Blue, this drive still manages to hold its own against the WD Blue in terms of performance. 

The Seagate Constellation even matches the Blue’s 7200RPM spin rate while integrating a cache of 128MB – that’s two times the size of the WD Blue!

**NOTE:** *We would like to stress that we highly recommend an SSD for swift and consistent loading times. However, we could not include one in the build due to budget constraints. 120GB SSDs can be found fairly cheap now on Amazon.*

PowerColor doesn’t exactly have the best reputation for good performance graphics cards, but you win some you lose some. 

In the past it would have been outrageous to ask for this kind of performance at a $400 price point, but those days are long gone. 

As we said before, AMD is a budgeteer’s best friend. 

Offering 60FPS+ in titles such as Grand Theft Auto V, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Battlefield V, Far Cry 5, and Forza Horizon 4, this GPU can get you by on your budget with no issues, and that’s before overclocking. 

At the time of writing, the PowerColor Red Dragon RX 570 4GB is also offering two free games upon purchase over at Newegg.

<h2>EVGA 450 BT 80+ Bronze Certified</h2>
<h3>Power Supply</h3>
<p>EVGA has graced us with an amazing budget option for PSUs. Their EVGA 450 BR offers many of the amazing aspects of a high-end power supply (including a five-year warranty) without all of the added cost.</p>

Your power supply can make or break your build (literally). 

It is one of the single most important parts of a computer and if you don’t take care while choosing, you may end up with a dead computer and an empty wallet.

450 watts is more than enough to supply either of our budget options without even working up a sweat. 

It also gives a bit of headroom for upgrading, but always do your research on possible upgrades and make sure you’ll have enough power.

Finally, the EVGA 450 BR has an 80 Plus Bronze efficiency rating, stating “85% efficiency or higher under typical loads,” according to Amazon. For an in-depth explanation of PSU efficiency ratings, check out this [Tom’s Hardware Article](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/what-80-plus-levels-mean,36721.html){: target="_blank"}.

<h2>Rosewill FBM-X1</h2>
<h3>Mini Tower</h3>
<p>Probably the least impressive part of this build is the case. Everyone wants a nice looking case with good airflow. However, you’re here on a budget, so we tried our best.</p>
<div class="btn">

</div>
</div>

The Rosewill FBM-X1 is the poor man’s high-end case. 

Offering an acrylic side panel window to view the amazing deals you’ve gotten, four front USB ports (two USB 2.0, two USB 3.0), surprisingly exceptional airflow, and a big ol’ blue LED power switch, it is pleasing if you have an open mind. 

Actually, you don’t need an open mind - you’re on a $400 budget, so you should be grateful you’re able to build such a sick gaming PC in the first place! 

This case comes with one front 120mm fan and one 80mm rear exhaust fan, though those will be your only options looking to the future unless you’re willing to do some major case modding. 

It may not seem like much, but it’ll keep your components cool and satisfied via the intake holes on the front of the case.

The FBM-X1 supports one 5.25” drive via the external bay at the front of the case, one 3.5” internal drive bay, and one 2.5” internal drive bay. 

That means, if you so choose, you can mount a disk drive or other expansion through the front 5.25” bay. You’ll even have that extra 2.5” drive bay for an SSD in the future.

## Performance Comparison 

If you're the kind of person who likes to look at the details, keep reading.

We're going to check out how these processors stack up against each other, at both stock and overclocked frequencies. 

In addition, we're also going to look at the differnt RAM kits' performance, and how the different CPUs affect in-game framerates. 

## Processor Base Performance
<img class="lazyload img-middle" alt="intel pentium vs ryzen 3 1200 chart" data-src="/img/400/base-cpu-chart.png" />

When compared to its Intel competitor – the Penitum G5400 – the Ryzen 1200 offers ~10% higher performance overall.

In fact, it comes out on top in almost every benchmark, with the exception of single core performance. 

The 1200 gains its edge via its extra physical cores, and will always pull ahead in multicore workloads that will make effective use of its 4 cores as opposed to the G5400’s 2. 

Fields that benefit from more cores include:

* Video and photo editing applications
* Productivity applications
* Graphics-intensive games
* 3D modeling applications
* Virtualization
* Multitasking

Let’s see if the 1200 can rebound that single core performance by overclocking.

### Processor Overclocked Performance 
<img class="lazyload img-middle" alt="overclocked cpu chart" data-src="/img/400/overclocked-cpu-chart.png" />

While it doesn’t quite reach the G5400 in single core performance, it comes very close to matching it, allowing it to compete easily in single core tasks. 

Oh, yeah, and it creates an even greater gap between the two processors in both quad-core and multi-core performance benchmarks.

### Performance in Games
<img class="lazyload img-middle" alt="game performance chart" data-src="/img/400/game-performance.png" />

What you’ve been waiting for, teams Red and Blue competing in gaming performance. 

The Ryzen 3 1200 comes out on top in most cases, with the exception of the single core hungry LoL and WoW (these tests were calculated without overclocking). 

Based on the gaming performance, it seems like AMD is the way to go given its large gaps in some games, with very small performance gaps in the majority.

## $400 Prebuilt Gaming PC
<img class="lazyload img-small img-right" alt="$400 prebuilt gaming pc" data-src="/img/400/prebuilt.jpg" />

Although I'd take a custom built PC over prebuilt any day of the week, not everyone wants to order parts and assemble them. 

It takes longer, and if you're a beginner, it can seem pretty challenging at first. 

That's why we've included this prebuilt PC in the guide. If you'd rather have a "plug and play" option that doesn't require much thinking, you can buy this computer and use it the moment it arrives at your doorstep.

**Processor**

The Intel i3-8100 offers better performance than either the Pentium Gold G5400 or the Ryzen 3 1200 (though the 1200 wins after overclocking). With 4 cores and 4 threads at a base of 3.6GHz, this CPU is ready to take on any games you can throw at it. Well, after you buy a GPU.

**Memory**

This PC comes with 8GB of DDR4 memory running at 2666MHz. The processor only supports up to 2666MHz so don't bank on any overclocking, but there is room to add more memory in the future.

One interesting addition is its 16GB of intel Optane cache memory. Optane memory, in short, increases the efficiency of mechanical hard drives, allowing them to run with SSD-like performance.

**Hard Drive**

The included 1TB 7200RPM SATA hard drive is sure to get you by with whatever your storage needs may be, and with the Intel Optane unit, it’ll be running at lightning fast speeds.

**IO**

This computer’s IO is very notable, especially for a pre-built. The front consists of an SD card reader, the usual headphone and microphone jacks, and two USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports, a Type-A and a Type-C. In the rear, you’re greeted with 2 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, and 4 USB 2.0 ports.

**Power Supply**

If you plan on adding in your own GPU, we advise you to change the power supply as well. Its measly 300W might have some trouble running a dedicated graphics card, and the last thing you’d want is to fry your new computer.

**Graphics**

As for choosing a new graphics card, that’s a bit difficult if you want to stay within a budget.

Considering the $400 initial price tag, you may be unwilling to buy that brand new RX 580 OC edition. We're on your side, don't spend more money than you need to. 

Our suggestion: Buy used. Head onto eBay and purchase a used RX 570 for around $100. 

If you want to spend even less (or more), buying an older series card may be the route for you. The GTX 900 series, the 960, 970, 980, and 980 Ti are all amazing budget used cards that still hold up in modern games very well in mid to high range settings.

**Intel Optane Overview**

Intel Optane is an M.2 PCIe 2280 SSD, basically, but it's also so much more.

Optane memory is a caching drive that uses software to automatically learn about your most frequently used programs and system behaviors to streamline your mechanical hard drive's performance.

The boost in performance isn't insignificant either, giving your new $40 1TB hard drive the speed of a $120 1TB SSD, or at least fairly close to it.

One amazing thing about Optane though, is that it doesn't need to be paired with a mechanical hard drive. You can pair Optane memory with a normal SATA SSD to bring salvation to that nasty SATA bottleneck.

The speeds that Optane can offer are off the charts, and calling it a game changer would be an understatement.

## Important Considerations

Since this guide is geared towards complete beginners, we wanted to cover all of the bases.

In this section, we're going to be discussing some of the other things you'll want to consider besides the PC itself. 

### Internet Connection

One very important note we need to make before our final section is internet connection.

Geez, how could we have overlooked such a major detail. How are you gonna play Apex: Legends without a gateway to your router?

Let's fix that.

**Wired:** As always, your go-to method of connection should always be via Ethernet. 

Ethernet offers the quickest direct connection to your router, and the rest of the internet by extension.

Picking the right Ethernet cable comes down to durability, speed, and length. As for speed, we recommend a newer CAT5e or CAT6 cable. 

Ethernet cables come in anywhere between 5 foot to 100 foot variants. Just make sure you measure the length between your system and your router before you buy.

We suggest purchasing any of Amazon's choice Ethernet cables, and can personally attest to their reliability.

**Wireless:** Not everyone can use an Ethernet solution.

Maybe you're just way too far away from your router, or you don't have a clear path for your cable to reach. Sometimes you just need to say no to wires.

Fear not, we have the solution!

For a quick USB adapter solution we have the OURLINK Mini 600MB/s Adapter.

For an internal solution, we recommend the Unit Bluetooth 1200MB/s WiFi Card, or TP-Link AC1300 Dual Band while it's on sale.

### Overclocking

As the Ryzen 3 1200, like all Ryzen processors, comes out of the box unlocked, it would be in your best interest to overclock your CPU in order to achieve the best possible performance for your money.

Overclocking is generally very simple, but if done wrong can mean disaster for your computer. 

Overclocking immediately voids your processor's warranty, and if done incorrectly, could result in a dead CPU and no backup plan. 

Nowadays most motherboards include an “OC Genie” which will automatically overclock to stable settings, though unfortunately, the B450M DS3H lacks this feature.

Don't fret just yet, worried fellow! For the simple man afraid to navigate the ravines and caverns of the BIOS in search of proper overclocking settings, AMD provides Ryzen Master.

Ryzen Master is a program that allows for easy overclocking within Windows. You don't even need to leave the comfort of your desktop to tinker with your CPU speed.

If you’re going to be using Ryzen Master, we suggest adjusting your CPU clock by .25GHz for each stress test until it freezes or blue-screens. Once you hit that freeze, just restart your computer and revert to the last stable setting.

### Peripherals

Don’t you dare start thinking we forgot the peripherals!

Sure, you’ve built your computer and you’re ready to start up and play some games, but wait, where’s your keyboard and mouse? Where’s your headset? Where the heck is your monitor?!

**Keyboard:** Redragon is one of the top dogs among budget keyboards, and their Redragon K558 ANALA is  proof of that.

Mechanical keyboards don’t generally come cheap, but the K558 offers the amazing feeling of mechanical keyboard for under $50.

The K558 sports multi-color backlighting with 8 colors and 4 brightness levels. Its amazing ABS keys give the K558 water resistance and outstanding durability, standing up to a staggering 50 million keystroke test, and its Redragon Blue Switches allow for broad keycap customizability.

It even comes with a braided cable, a gold-plated USB connector, and a palm rest!

**Mouse:** Redragon’s at it again with the budget peripherals, this time with the Redragon M711 Cobra.

The amount of features jam-packed into this budget mouse is astonishingly awesome. Adjustable DPI levels, programmable buttons, and its own programming software? 

Unbelievable.

The M711 has 5 DPI levels: 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 5000, but can also be adjusted manually from 100 to 10000, allowing for fine-tuning to fit exactly what your needs may entail.

If you’ve ever needed extra quick keymaps for games, this is the mouse for you. It has 7 individually programmable buttons that can be mapped to anything you might want.

RGB! 16.8million is a really big number, we know, but hopefully, somewhere in the millions of colors this mouse can pump into its LEDs, you can find exactly the color combination that matches your setup.

**Headset:** Gaming headsets are important, as sound quality can make or break your experience. 

For a budget setup like this, we recommend the Behringer HPX2000.

Whether you’re listening for the next callout in a CS:GO match or mixing down the next track for your upcoming concert, the Behringer HPX2000 is the only budget option. The amazing performance you receive for under $20 is almost unimaginable. 

They’re comfortable and lightweight so your long sessions won’t have to be interrupted by the pain of adjusting your headphones.

You can expect the audio quality of a pair of headphones that would cost three to four times as much, and they do an outstanding job at emulating location in 3D space.

They even come with a 3.5mm to ¼” adapter for any audio interfaces you may want to use.

**Microphone:** If you want premium audio quality, the Blue Snowball is a great mic, offering the best bang for your buck. 

I’ve been using one for the past few years, and I absolutely love it. 

Add in a cheap pop filter and you’ll be set for some exceptional quality.

This microphone comes with a tripod style stand for your desk so you can place it wherever, but from personal experience, there is nowhere you can put it on your desk where it won’t be in the way.

Lucky for you, the Blue Snowball is compatible with most adjustable suspension mic stands. 

We recommend a combination with some of Amazon’s top picks of microphone accessories to go along with the Snowball.

**Monitor:** The Acer SB220Q is Amazon’s choice, and now it’s ours as well. 

This LED-lit monitor is one of the cheapest 1920x1080 options you can find.

The SB220Q sits at 21.5” in size while offering slimness usually only found in laptop screens. Coming in at a thickness of just 0.24-inches, fitting this monitor on your desk will be no problem.

There are a couple of other notable features in this full HD 1920x1080 monitor. Rocking a response time of only 4ms and a refresh rate of 75Hz for only $90 it seems like a dream, but go ahead and pinch yourself – we’re sure you will find it’s all real.

To go along with your shiny new Radeon RX 570, the SB220Q also harbors support for AMD FreeSync, so say goodbye to frame skipping!
