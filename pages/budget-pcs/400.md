Gaming on an extreme budget has never been easier. This is the #1 best budget gaming PC under $400 for your money in 2017. All of the parts have been hand picked with the best price to performance in mind. 

### The Processor 

Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for a budget gaming computer. The processor is a very important part of every PC. All of the information the computer needs to function passes through this component. Though most games are not very CPU intensive, it is still important to have a processor that can keep up with the graphics card without bottlenecking. This is why the Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for a $400 build. It has a base clock of 3.5GHz, which is less than the i3-6100's clock speed of 3.9GHz. However, due to its Kaby Lake architecture, it can be paired with 2400MHz ram. This actually improves the performance, and comepensates for its frequency deficit.  It only has 2 physical cores, however it has hyperthreading, meaning it has 4 threads. This, in effect, enables the CPU to process as though it has 4 cores.
