## $400 Build Guide 

### The Case 
![FBM-X1](/img/case/fbm-x1.jpg "Rosewill FBM-X1"){: .img-right .img-small}


The case is more than just a pretty looking box. In fact, it is much more than that. 

A good case must be: 

* Eye catching 
* Aerodynamic (if you will)
* The right size 
* Spacious
* Compatible for you

These factors must be kept in mind when deciding which case is right for you. This is why the [Rosewill - FBM-X1 MicroATX Mini Tower Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072F29JP4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B072F29JP4&linkId=8e7a1aa860b438bde64443e1e3ed9555) is the case of choice for this build. 

This case is an amazing deal. For under $30, you're getting a case with a side panel window, and front panel USB 3.0 headers. 

Most cases with these features are usually in the $40+ range. Furthermore, [cable management](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/373906-31-cable-management-important) is no problem.

Cable management is important to keep in the back of your head when wiring your PC.

Not only does it make the inside of your PC look better, it improves airflow. This helps to keep your PC nice and cool while you're pushing it to the limit. 

Specs: 

* Type - MicroATX Mini Tower
* Color - Black
* External 5.25" Bays - 1
* Internal 3.5" Bays - 1
* Internal 2.5" Bays - 1
* Motherboard Compatibility - Micro ATX, Mini ITX
* Maximum Video Card Length - 11.81"

### The Processor 
![Pentium G4560](/img/cpu/pentium.png "Pentium G4560"){: .img-right .img-small}

The Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for any budget gaming computer.

Here's why:

Though most games are not very processor intensive, it is still important to have a processor that can keep up with the graphics card without [bottlenecking](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/191480-28-what-bottlenecking).

 The Pentium G4560 has a base clock of 3.5GHz, which is less than the i3-6100's clock speed of 3.9GHz. 

 But that is the best part. 

 Due to the brand new Kaby Lake architecture, it can be paired with 2400MHz ram. What does this mean? 

 It means that using higher frequency ram can compensate for the processor's frequency deficit. 

 But here's the kicker: 

 Even though this processor can be found for $60, it outperforms the i3-6100, which is priced over $100. 


Specs:

 * Cores - 2
 * Threads - 4 
 * Hyperthreading - Yes 
 * Base Frequency - 3.5 GHz
 * TDP - 54 W
 * Cache - 3 MB
 * Lithography - 14 nm
 * Memory Types - DDR4-2133/2400, DDR3L-1333/1600 @ 1.35V

 Hyperthreading technology is what makes this processor so powerful. Though it only has 2 physical cores, each core is able to process 2 threads, instead of just one.

 So what? What's the big deal? 

 The big deal is, this means it effectively has 4 cores, not 2. 

 Each thread acts as its own core. The processor, instead of having just 2 physical cores, now has 2 physical and 2 theoretical cores. Video games, editing softwares, etc. detect 4 cores, not two. Since most games utilize all 4 cores of a processor, this is incredible.

### The Motherboard 
![MSI Pro Series Intel B250 micro-ATX Motherboard](/img/mobo/b250 msi.png "MSI Pro Series Intel B250 micro-ATX Motherboard"){: .img-small .img-right}


The MSI Pro Series Intel B250 micro-ATX motherboard is the motherboard of choice for this build. 

Not only is it sexy, it is reliable and easy to use. 

The best part? 

This motherboard has a b250 chipset. This is very important. It allows for the use of 2400MHz memory, which boosts the performance of the processor. 

What's the bottom line here? 

For less than $70, you are getting a component that will not only do a great job, it will do that job for a long time. 


Specs:

* Socket - 1151
* Chipset - IntelÂ® B250 Chipset
* Memory - DDR4 2400/ 2133 MHz
* Memory Channel - Dual
* DIMM Slots - 2
* Max Memory (GB) - 32

Here at Easy PC, getting the best bang for your buck is high on the list of priorities. This means recommending parts that will last a long time. This motherboard will do just that.

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/corsair-1x4gb.png "Corsair Vengeance LPX 4GB (1 x 4GB) DDR4 2400 MHz ram"){: .img-right .img-small}

The most important part of any gaming PC is the GPU. On such a low budget, it's important to allocate all possible resources towards the best GPU. 

Unfortunately, this does mean cutting corners in other areas of the build. 

Though 8GB of ram is optimal, this build is only able to include 4GB of ram. 1 stick of [Corsair Vengeance LPX 4GB (1 x 4GB) DDR4 2400 MHz ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ARGVZPU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01ARGVZPU&linkId=50208d8cabeb903eb78141fe069777da) was chosen. 

On the bright side, it is clocked at 2400 MHz, boosting the performance of the CPU under load.

At the end of the day, 4GB of ram will have a minor impact on in game performance, and can easily be upgraded in the future. 
Specs:

* Type - 288 pin DIMM
* Speed - DDR4-2400
* Size - 4GB (1x4GB)
