### The Case 

Housing everything in your build, the case is often overlooked. 

Why? 

The case is more than just a pretty looking box. In fact, it is much more than that. 

A good case must be: 

* Eye catching 
* Aerodynamic (if you will)
* The right size 
* Spacious
* Compatible for you

These factors must be kept in mind when deciding which case is right for you. This is why the Cougar MX200 is the case of choice for this build. 

This case features 2 120mm fan vents with pre-installed red LED's. It is sleek, refined, spacious, and compatible with the build. Furthermore, [cable management](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/373906-31-cable-management-important) is no problem.

Cable management is important to keep in the back of your head when wiring your PC.

Not only does it make the inside of your PC look better, it improves airflow. This helps to keep your PC nice and cool while you're pushing it to the limit. 

Specs: 

* Type - ATX Mid Tower
* Color - Black
* External 5.25" Bays - 2
* Internal 3.5" Bays - 6
* Internal 2.5" Bays - 1
* Motherboard Compatibility - ATX, Micro ATX
* Maximum Video Card Length - 9.45"

### The Processor 

The Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for any budget gaming computer.

Here's why:

Though most games are not very processor intensive, it is still important to have a processor that can keep up with the graphics card without [bottlenecking](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/191480-28-what-bottlenecking).

 The Pentium G4560 has a base clock of 3.5GHz, which is less than the i3-6100's clock speed of 3.9GHz. 

 But that is the best part. 

 Due to the brand new Kaby Lake architecture, it can be paired with 2400MHz ram. What does this mean? 

 It means that using higher frequency ram can compensate for the processor's frequency deficit. 

 But here's the kicker: 

 Even though this processor can be found for $60, it outperforms the i3-6100, which is priced over $100. 


Specs:

 * Cores - 2
 * Threads - 4 
 * Hyperthreading - Yes 
 * Base Frequency - 3.5 GHz
 * TDP - 54 W
 * Cache - 3 MB
 * Lithography - 14 nm
 * Memory Types - DDR4-2133/2400, DDR3L-1333/1600 @ 1.35V

 Hyperthreading technology is what makes this processor so powerful. Though it only has 2 physical cores, each core is able to process 2 threads, instead of just one.

 So what? What's the big deal? 

 The big deal is, this means it effectively has 4 cores, not 2. 

 Each thread acts as its own core. The processor, instead of having just 2 physical cores, now has 2 physical and 2 theoretical cores. Video games, editing softwares, etc. detect 4 cores, not two. Since most games utilize all 4 cores of a processor, this is incredible.
