---

This is the #1 best budget gaming PC under $400 for your money in 2017. All of the parts have been hand picked with the best price to performance in mind. 

### The Processor 

The Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for any budget gaming computer.

Here's why:

Though most games are not very CPU intensive, it is still important to have a processor that can keep up with the graphics card without bottlenecking.

 It has a base clock of 3.5GHz, which is less than the i3-6100's clock speed of 3.9GHz. 

 But that is the best part. 

 Due to the brand new Kaby Lake architecture, it can be paired with 2400MHz ram. What does this mean? 

 It means that using higher frequency ram can compensate for the processor's frequency deficit. 

 But here's the kicker: 

 Even though this processor can be found for $60, it outperforms the i3-6100, which is priced over $100. 

All the more reason to but it [now](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCE8T92/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01NCE8T92&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=69a3b5167482f5d9a55a6f56ae5bc656)

### The Motherboard 

The MSI Pro Series Intel B250 micro-ATX motherboard is the motherboard of choice for this build. 

Not only is it sexy, it is reliable and easy to use. 

The best part? 

This motherboard has a b250 chipset. This is very important. It allows for the use of 2400MHz memory, which boosts the performance of the processor. 

What's the bottom line here? 

For less than $70, you are getting a component that will not only do a great job, it will do that job for a long time.

### The Ram 

You can't go wrong with 8GB of ram. 

This build is sporting a Ballistix Sport LT 8GB kit (2x4GB) of DDR4 2400 ram. 

The ram is important because it is 2400 MHz, not 2133 MHz. This boosts the CPU performance.
