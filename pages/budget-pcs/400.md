This is the #1 best budget gaming PC under $400 for your money in 2017. All of the parts have been hand picked with the best price to performance in mind. 

### The Processor 

The Pentium G4560 is the perfect choice for any budget gaming computer.

Here's why:

Though most games are not very CPU intensive, it is still important to have a processor that can keep up with the graphics card without bottlenecking.

 It has a base clock of 3.5GHz, which is less than the i3-6100's clock speed of 3.9GHz. 

 But that is the best part. 

 Due to the brand new Kaby Lake architecture, it can be paired with 2400MHz ram. What does this mean? 

 It means that using higher frequency ram can compensate for the frequency deficit. 

 But here's the kicker: 

 Even though this processor can be found for $60, it outperforms the i3-6100, which is priced over $100.
