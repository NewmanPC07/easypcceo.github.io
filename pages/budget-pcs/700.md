## The Phoenix 

This build is named the Phoenix for a reason. If you know anything about a phoenix, then you know they're awesome, as is this gaming PC. It's the best gaming PC under $700. 

A [$500 gaming PC](/budget-pcs/500/) isn't what it used to be. You'll have to spend $700 or more in 2018 to achieve the same performance that $500 would've gotten you a year ago thanks to cryptocurrency miners buying out GPUs and driving the prices through the roof. 

It's sporting a [Ryzen 3 1200](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0741DN383/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0741DN383&linkId=8d31b891d281885eded57ad6ef540469){:target="_blank"} which is a quad-core CPU with extreme overclocking potential. 

This means you'll be able to harness even more power out of your CPU, even with AMD's stock cooling solution. 

It also has a [GTX 1060 3GB](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338264454&customid=&icep_uq=GTX+1060+3GB&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}, great for gaming in 1080p and beyond. You'll see 60+ FPS with high-ultra settings in nearly all titles. 

You can expect to see 100+ FPS in competitive eSports titles like CS:GO and LOL. We know every frame counts, as it can be the difference between a win and a loss. 

I decided to link the GPU to eBay, as I figured you'd probably be able to find a better deal. GPU prices are crazy high right now, so it might not be a bad idea to buy a used GPU in order to save money. If you do buy used, make sure the card wasn't used for mining as that can really take a toll on the lifespan of the card.

If you'd rather buy new, that's fine too!

![Bitfenix Comrade](/img/case/comrade.png){: .img-middle}

The main purpose of this PC is gaming, and the parts were picked accordingly.  I'd like to address two things. 

First of all, I chose 8GB of RAM for this build. I know some newer games are recommending 12GB and even 16GB of ram. I also know that right now, RAM prices are through the roof. When push comes to shove, the GPU is far more important than RAM.  

Furthermore, *8GB of RAM is still plenty for a gaming PC under $700.* You won't suffer a notable loss of performance in-game. Most importantly of all, with the money you save on RAM you'll be able to spend on the GPU. From a gaming standpoint, it's the best move. 

Second of all, I decided to skip the HDD altogether and instead go for a 240GB [SSD](http://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd){:target="_blank"}. 

The SSD doesn't really have any impact on performance in-game, but they're pretty sweet otherwise. They transform a 2-3 minute boot time into a 30 second boot time. 

Do you ever feel like you have to wait for your PC or laptop to 'warm up'? That's probably because you have a mechanical hard drive. SSDs work immediately. As soon as you turn on your PC it'll be ready to go. It also greatly increases your games' loading speeds. You'll be the first one loaded into every match!

The only downfall of an SSD is the price per GB of storage. It's a bit more than four times that of a mechanical drive. Instead of having 1TB of mass storage you're only going to have 240GB of space, so you'll have to watch your space.

I'd highly recommend adding a 500GB or ideally a 1TB mass storage mechanical drive to the build if you have the money for the addition. They can be found for less than $50 on Amazon. You can store your movies, music and other programs on this drive.

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEIbbC_JxX4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Is an SSD Worth the Money? 

SSDs are quite pricey, especially compared to mechanical drives. For example, a 240GB SSD will cost you around $60, while a 1TB mechanical drive costs $50. 

So, are they really worth it? 

*YES*. Yes they are. 

SSDs are much faster than mechanical drives. If you buy a 240GB SSD, you can store your Windows OS, drivers, and some of your favorite games on it. Your PC's boot speeds will dramatically increase â€“ furthermore, the overall compuer's usability is better, too. 

If you have evert felt like you need to let your PC 'warm up' after turning it on, you probably have a mechanical drive. With an SSD, you won't have to wait anymore! 

<figure>
	<img class="img-middle" alt="SSD example" src="/img/hdd/example.jpg" />
	<figcaption>SSDs significantly improve your PC's performance!</figcaption>
</figure>

Seriously, your PC will be ready to go within 30 seconds of hitting the power button. It's no joke! 

In addition, games installed on your SSD will load incredibly quickly. You'll be among the first loaded in the game! 

Of course, 240GB is not a lot of storage if you like to download photos, music, movies, applications, etc. For your mass storage, you can buy a 1TB mechanical hard drive. They're cheap, and work perfectly for regular file storage. 

*If you have the money for an SSD, buy one! They make your user experience 100x better!*

## Custom vs. Prebuilt Gaming PCs

Most prebuilt gaming PCs come with a powerful CPU, like an Intel i7. They have lots of RAM and a huge hard drive. Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you the truth. 

What truth? 

Those things don't matter. They put crappy components in a nice case and market it as a "gaming PC". 

Well, we have news for you. These overpriced and underpowered prebuilt "gaming PCs" don't deserve the title. Video games aren't really processed by the CPU. In fact, they're processed by the GPU. The GPU is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering and graphical processing. Hence the name "Graphics Processing Unit". 

As long as your CPU is fast enough to keep up with the GPU, you're in good shape. This means you can save some money and buy a cheaper CPU. With the money you saved, spend it on a more powerful GPU. Your powerful GPU will handle all of the 3D rendering in game, resulting in great FPS. 

![Gaming Setup](/img/pc-gaming/setup.jpg){: .img-middle}

However, this doesn't mean you can buy the cheapest CPU on the market. If your CPU is too underpowered, it'll hold back the GPU. This is called *bottlenecking*.

Anyway, back to the parts of a prebuilt gaming PC. Remember how I told you the GPU does all of the heavy lifting? Well, if you bought a prebuilt desktop with an Intel i7 and a GTX 750, you're out of luck.

Fortunately in 2018 *there are some viable prebuilt options*. You have to know what you're looking for, but if you buy the right PC you can actually make your money go a long way. 

Crytpocurrency miners want GPUs, not gaming PCs. This is why prebuilt PCs have maintained relatively the same (low) price. 

## A Prebuilt Gaming PC Under $700 
<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH"><img class="img-middle" src="/img/case/xtreme.png" /></a>


Though most prebuilt gaming PCs are a ripoff, there are some viable prebuilt options. In this section, we're going to be taking a look at the best prebuilt gaming PC for $700. *Note that prices fluctuate daily.*

We think the [Cyberpower Gamer Xtreme VR](http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH){:target="_blank"} is the best prebuilt gaming PC for the money. 

**Let's take a look at the specs:** 

* Intel Core i5-7400 3.0GHz Quad-Core Processor
* 8GB DDR4 RAM
* 1TB HDD
* AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB
* Windows 10 

For $700, you're getting a PC with a 7th generation i5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and an RX 580 4GB, not to mention a full version of Windows 10. 

This is a great deal, considering you're also getting the PC prebuilt and shipped to your door. It comes in an awesome case too! 

You can expect to see 60+ FPS in most new titles with this PC, running at high-ultra settings.

## Build Guide

### The Case 
![Bitfenix - Comrade](/img/case/bitfenix-comrade.png "bitfenix-comrade"){: .img-small .img-right}


Some spend lots of money on their case. A [good case](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/select-case,468.html){: target="_blank"} NEEDS to have these aspects: 

* Good cable management
* Good airflow
* [USB 3.0](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-usb-20-and-30/){:target="_blank"} Support
* Plenty of Space 
* Hard Drive Bays 
* Fans

That being said, many desire a good looking case as well. However, it is not necessary. 

The case chosen for this build, the [Bitfenix - Comrade](https://amzn.to/2LrnvBX){:target="_blank"} has all of the important aspects.  

For more information on cases, check out our guide on the [smallest ATX cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/)!

Specs: 

* Type: ATX Mid Tower
* Color: White
* Includes Power Supply: No
* External 5.25" Bays: 3
* Internal 2.5" Bays: 3
* Internal 3.5" Bays: 3

### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-right .img-small}

A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate [CPU](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150){:target="_blank"} is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://amzn.to/2O6xXx2){:target="_blank"} is a great budget gaming CPU. It is able to hold its own in just about every game, especially when paired with a powerful GPU like the Radeon RX 580.  

This CPU also boasts incredible overclocking potential even with AMD's stock cooling solution. If you want to use the default stock cooler that ships with the Ryzen 5 1400, you should be able to achieve moderate overclocking, as the Ryzen stock coolers are actually quite good. 

If you want to achieve heavy overclocking, consider buying an aftermarket CPU cooler. 

Anyway, thanks to GPU and RAM prices finally cooling off, we're able to include the Ryzen 5 and an RX 580 in this build, as opposed to a Ryzen 3 and a GTX 1060. More on that later. 

**Here are the CPU's specs:**

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Cores: 4
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (8 Threads)

### The Motherboard 
![ASRock AB350M](/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png "ASRock AB350M"){: .img-small .img-right}

Deciding which motherboard is right for you can be a daunting task. 

With many things to consider such as chipset, socket type, ram slots, PCI-E slots, fan connnectors, etc. it can be a lot to tackle all at once.

Fortunately, we've done all of the heavy lifting for you. 

For this build, the [ASRock - AB350M micro ATX AM4 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9LN3QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06X9LN3QK&linkId=f6f55287ac06445f3097836d1db39bf8){.big-button target="_blank"} was chosen. It supports 2400 MHz ram, it has onboard USB 3.0 headers, and much more. 

This motherboard pretty much has everything you need in a micro ATX form factor. 

Specs: 

* CPU Socket Type: AM4

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B350 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our Ryzen CPU under heavy load.

### The Solid State Drive
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LrWO00"><img class="img-small img-right" src="/img/hdd/sandisk-240.png" /></a>

The [SanDisk Ultra II 240GB SSD](https://amzn.to/2LrWO00){:target="_blank"} was chosen as the storage solution for this build. 

Although you're not getting nearly the same amount of storage as a traditional mechanical hard drive, you'll love the performance that this drive delivers. 

You'll experience **much faster boot speeds, loading times, and a better overall experience**. 

If you've ever felt like you needed to let your computer warm-up before you can really use it, it's probably because you have a mechanical hard drive. An SSD is ready to go immediately; although it doesn't really impact your in-game performance, it is definitely worth it. 

[Check out these ten reasons why you should buy an SSD](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/store-ssd-10-reasons-to-buy){:target="_blank"}!

At the same time, having 1TB of storage can't hurt. If you can afford the additional $50, I recommend adding one to this build for your music, movies, and other programs.

### The Graphics Card 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ"><img class="img-small img-right" src="/img/gpu/gigabyte-rx-580.png" /></a>

The GPU is easily the most important part of any gaming rig. Any well optimized PC game will primarily harness the power of your GPU, followed by your CPU and your ram, respectfully. 

For this $700 build, the [Gigabyte - Radeon RX 580 8GB Gaming 8G Video Card](https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ){: target="_blank"} was chosen. 

The RX 580 is one of the best GPUs on the market for less than $300. You can overclock it easily, and it is boasting 8GB of dedicated memory. If you want to play games in 1080p with high and ultra settings, having a lot of dedicated VRAM is important.

Moreover, this GPU is also a great cryptocurrency mining GPU. If you buy one now while it's cheap (GPU prices have cooled down because the cryptocurrency market is lower), you'll be able to use it for mining in the future, if you wish. 

For less than $300, this GPU is a steal. The RX 580 and Ryzen 5 1400 will deliver 60FPS in 1080p with high-ultra settings in most (if not all) titles. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: Radeon RX 580
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Memory Size: 8GB
* Core Clock: 1.26 GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.35 GHz
* TDP: 185 Watts
* Length: 9.13"
* DVI-D Dual-Link: 1
* Displayport: 3
* HDMI: 1

### The Power Supply
![Corsair CX550M](/img/PSU/cx550m.png "Corsair CX550M"){: .img-small .img-right}

This build is pretty power efficient, but I decided to choose a powerful, efficient and future-proof PSU to power the components. 

The [Corsair CX550M](https://amzn.to/2JJDDJU){:target="_blank"} was selected. It's an efficient 80+ Bronze Certified power supply, and it's semi modular. This will help with cable management. 

Having good cable management not only improves the looks of your build, but with airflow as well. This is important as you'll ideally be overclocking your CPU and RAM to achieve maximum performance. If you'd like you could even overclock your GPU. 

Since GPU prices are high, we had to save on other components. Overclocking the Ryzen 3 1200 is a great way to get the most out of the CPU, especially considering its insane overclocking potential. 

Ryzen's performance heavily depends on RAM speed which is why I'd recommend you overclock your RAM as well. This PSU has more than enough power to get the job done, and it's efficient too!

Specs:

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 550 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
* Efficiency: 80+ Bronze
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 2

## Intel i3 vs. Ryzen 3 

Up until recently, it was obvious that AMD's Ryzen 3 line held the title of "The King of Budget Gaming CPUs". Before Ryzen 3 was released, your only real options were the skylake i3 CPUs, or the Pentium G4560. Both choices didn't sport four cores; only dual cores with hyperthreading. 

At the time they were great, as the four threads did a great job. Of course, once AMD launched a quad core CPU for a lower price, it was game over. AMD's Ryzen line outperformed Intel's closest offerings in just about every category except for single-threaded performance. 

As we all expected, Intel fought back. They released their Coffe Lake CPUs, the 8th generation of the Intel i3 line. They're priced similarly to the Ryzen 3 line, and they have four true cores as well. In fact, they show similar if not better performance in most categories. 

Unfortunately, the lowest-priced motherboards available for this chip at this time are all over $100. This makes it hard to consider them a "budget gaming CPU". 

Until cheaper motherboards are released for the new line of Intel CPUs, Ryzen 3 will remain our budget CPU of choice. 

We also have a guides for [$400](/budget-pcs/400/), [$500](/budget-pcs/500/), [$600](/budget-pcs/600/), and [$800](/budget-pcs/800/) budget gaming PCs!

Lastly, you'll need the best gaming mouse to accompany your new gaming PC. If you're left handed, finding a good mouse can be tricky. Check out our guide on the [best left handed gaming mice](/left-handed-gaming-mouse/)!
