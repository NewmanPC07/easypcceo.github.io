## The Phoenix: A $700 Gaming PC

A Phoenix is a mythical creature. 

Why is this PC named The Phoenix?

Because, just like a phoenix, it's bad ass. 

If you're looking for a gaming PC capable of destroying any title in 1080p or 1440p, this is the one for you. 

Better still, this PC is also well suited for other workstation tasks, from recording and rendering to Photoshop and streaming – this PC can do it all!

## 700 Dollar Gaming PC Build Guide

Now that you've taken a look at a table of the parts, we're going to take a closer look at each component of this monster of a $700 gaming PC. 

### The Case 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2H2z7bG"><img alt="700 dollar gaming pc case choice" class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/700/700-case.jpg" /></a>

Some people choose to spend lots of money on their case. A [good case](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/select-case,468.html){: target="_blank"} NEEDS to have these aspects: 

* Good cable management
* Good airflow
* [USB 3.0](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-usb-20-and-30/){:target="_blank"} support
* Plenty of Space 
* Hard Drive Bays 
* Fans
* Visually pleasing

The [Cooler Master MasterBox Lite 5](https://amzn.to/2H2z7bG){:target="_blank"} has all of the important aspects. 

This is definitely a [small ATX case](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/), but there's still plenty of room for components, and cable management is a breeze as well.

It has a spacious interior, as it is technically a mid-tower ATX case. 

Here are some of the case's specs:

Specs: 

* Type: ATX Mid Tower
* Color: Black/Red
* Includes Power Supply: No
* Internal 2.5" Bays: 1
* Internal 3.5" Bays: 2
* Motherboard Compatibility: ATX, Micro ATX, Mini ITX

This case doesn't have a 5.25" bay for optical drives, a design choice that's becoming ever more popular these days. Removing the optical drive – which, let's be honest, is hardly ever used – frees up loads of space in the case for other important components like fans, radiators, pumps, and cables. 

Overall, this is a solid case from a reputable company. It gets the job done for a fair price.

### The Processor
<img alt="Ryzen 5 2600 700 dollar gaming pc processor choice" class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png" />

A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies primarily on the GPU. After all, it is responsible for 3D rendering and other tasks of that nature. 

Nevertheless, an adequate [CPU](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150){:target="_blank"} is still important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks.

If your CPU is too slow in comparison to your GPU, you'll experience bottlenecking and frame drops/stutters. 

You can figure out if your CPU/GPU will bottleneck with this handy [bottleneck percentage calculator](https://pc-builds.com/calculator/){: target="_blank"}.

The [Ryzen 5 2600](https://amzn.to/2VFbrCd){:target="_blank"} is a great budget gaming CPU. Thanks to its high clock speed, impressive overclocking performance, 6 cores and 12 threads, this processor definitely holds its own. 

Its performance is comparable to Team Blue's offerings in the same price range – in fact, this CPU actually comes out on top in many gaming related performance tests.  

As mentioned previosuly, the Ryzen 5 2600 boasts incredible overclocking potential even with AMD's stock cooling solution. If you want to use the default stock cooler that ships with the Ryzen 5 2600, you should be able to achieve moderate overclocking, as the Ryzen stock coolers are actually quite good. 

If you want to achieve heavy overclocking, consider buying an aftermarket CPU cooler. 

You can't unlock the full potential of a CPU without overclocking, and this is especially true with AMD's Ryzen line. We highly recommend you overclock this CPU, even if it's a light overclockw with the stock cooler. There are plenty of Ryzen overclocking tutorials online. 

**Here are the CPU's specs:**

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.4 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.9 GHz
* Cores: 6
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (12 Threads)

### The Motherboard 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JefPBt"><img alt="MSI B450M GAMING PLUS 700 dollar gaming pc motherboard choice" class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png" /></a>

Deciding which motherboard is right for you can be a daunting task. 

With many things to consider such as chipset, socket type, ram slots, PCI-E slots, fan connnectors, etc. it can be a lot to tackle all at once.

Fortunately, we've done all of the heavy lifting for you. 

For this build, the [MSI B450M GAMING PLUS](https://amzn.to/2JefPBt){target="_blank"} was chosen. It supports 2400 MHz ram, has onboard USB 3.0 headers, and much more. 

It's pretty much everything you need in a Micro-ATX form factor. 

Specs: 

* CPU Socket Type: AM4
* Chipset: AMD B450
* Memory Slots: 2 x 288-pin DIMM
* Memory Type: up to 3466
* Maximum Supported Memory: 32GB
* Crossfire/SLI Support: No 
* Raid Support: Yes
* Sata 6 GB/s: 4 
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps
* Onboard USB 3.0 Headers: Yes

The B450M GAMING PLUS has a B450 chipset, which is great for overclocking. It's basically the second generation of the B350 chipset, which was the entry-level overclocking chipset created for Ryzen's first generation of CPUs. 

The B450 chipset was released pretty much alongside the launch of Ryzen's second generation 2000 series CPUs, which is why this motherboard was chosen for the build. It has basic features and supports overclocking, without anything extra that would raise the price.

### The Ram 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZR1n8x"><img alt="700 dollar gaming pc RAM choice" class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png" /></a>

Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. This is especially true with Ryzen CPUs, as their performance is definitely impacted by RAM speed more than other CPUs on the market. 

Don't worry, this isn't an issue – as long as you have fast RAM, you'll be in good shape. In fact, the faster your RAM, the better. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz RAM](https://amzn.to/2ZR1n8x) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* CAS Latency: 16
* Heat Spreader: No

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB isn't much at all. 

Thanks to the motherboard's B450 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our Ryzen CPU under heavy load. 

[View Price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2ZR1n8x){: .big-button target="_blank"}

### The Solid State Drive
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DKlWtS"><img alt="700 dollar gaming pc ssd choice" class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/700/700-ssd.jpg" /></a>

The [Kingston A400 240GB SSD](https://amzn.to/2DKlWtS){:target="_blank"} was chosen as the storage solution for this build. 

Although you're not getting nearly the same amount of storage as a traditional mechanical hard drive, you'll love the performance that this drive delivers. 

You'll experience **much faster boot speeds, loading times, and a better overall experience**. 

If you've ever felt like you needed to let your computer warm-up before you can really use it, it's probably because you have a mechanical hard drive. An SSD is ready to go immediately; although it doesn't really impact your in-game performance, it is definitely worth it. 

[Check out these ten reasons why you should buy an SSD](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/store-ssd-10-reasons-to-buy){:target="_blank"}!

At the same time, having 1TB of storage can't hurt. If you can afford the additional $50, I recommend adding one to this build for your music, movies, and other programs.

### The Graphics Card 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Y79xYm"><img alt="700 dollar gaming pc gpu choice" class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/700/700-gpu.png" /></a>

The GPU is easily the most important part of any gaming rig. Any well optimized PC game will primarily harness the power of your GPU, followed by your CPU and your RAM, respectively. 

For this 700 gaming pc build, the [MSI GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6 GB VENTUS XS OC](https://amzn.to/2Y79xYm){: target="_blank"} was chosen. 

It's brand new from NVIDIA, and it's one of the best GPUs on the market today. 

Although the way it was named doesn't make much sense (they went from 1060 to 1660 for some reason) the GPU is an absolute powerhouse. 

It's comparable in power to the GTX 1070, and in some cases, it even outperforms the GTX 1070. 

The best part? 

It's much cheaper than a GTX 1070, despite being brand new!

For less than $300, this GPU is a steal. The GTX 1660 Ti and Ryzen 5 2600 will deliver 60FPS in 1080p with ultra settings in all titles, and you can game in 1440p with high-ultra settings as well. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
* Memory Type: GDDR6
* Memory Size: 6GB
* Core Clock: 1.5 GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.83 GHz
* TDP: 120 Watts
* Length: 8.03"
* G-Sync: Yes
* Displayport: 3
* HDMI: 1

### The Power Supply
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2V17ovw"><img alt="700 dollar gaming pc psu choice" class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/700/700-psu.jpg" /></a>

This build is pretty power efficient, but I decided to choose a powerful, efficient and future-proof PSU to power the components. 

The [Corsair TXM 550](https://amzn.to/2V17ovw){:target="_blank"} was selected to power the build. It's an efficient 80+ Gold Certified power supply, and it's semi modular. This will help with cable management. 

Having good cable management not only improves the looks of youryou'd like you could even overclock your GPU.  build, but with airflow as well. This is important as you'll ideally be overclocking your CPU and RAM to achieve maximum performance. If 

Ryzen's performance heavily depends on RAM speed which is why I'd recommend you overclock your RAM as well. This PSU has more than enough power to get the job done, and it's efficient too!

Specs:

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 550 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
* Efficiency: 80+ Gold
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 2

## My Thoughts on a $700 Gaming PC 

I've been a PC gamer since I was 13 when I built my first gaming PC in the 8th grade. 

Prior to my enlightenment, I played a whole lot of Call of Duty on the Xbox 360. When the Xbox One came out, I decided I'd rather build a gaming PC than buy a new console. 

I could either: 

**A)** Buy a $500 Xbox One and a $500 laptop

*or*

**B)** Build a $1,000 gaming computer 

I decided to build a $1,000 gaming computer, because a gaming PC with that budget can game in higher resolution, with better graphics and framerates, than an Xbox. Additionally, it can do everything a normal computer can do! 

Actually, I spent $700 on the PC. Now I'm going to share my experience with the build: 

It was my first build, and I didn't really know what I was doing. I spent too much on the processor, and too little on the graphics card. 

Despite my poor choice of components, the PC was still *awesome*. You can build a mean gaming PC with $700.

I ended up selling my PC after two years, because I didn't have a job and I wanted money for a car. I built another gaming PC one year ago with another $700 budget, and it runs all of the games I want to play with great framerates in 1080p. 

What's the bottom line here?

With $700, you can build not only a powerful gaming PC, but a great computer as well. If you're thinking of joining the PC gaming community, $700 is an ideal budget.  

## Intel i3 vs. Ryzen 3 

Up until recently, it was obvious that AMD's Ryzen 3 line held the title of "The King of Budget Gaming CPUs". Before Ryzen 3 was released, your only real options were the skylake i3 CPUs, or the Pentium G4560. Both choices didn't sport four cores; only dual cores with hyperthreading. 

At the time they were great, as the four threads did a great job. Of course, once AMD launched a quad core CPU for a lower price, it was game over. AMD's Ryzen line outperformed Intel's closest offerings in just about every category except for single-threaded performance. 

As we all expected, Intel fought back. They released their Coffe Lake CPUs, the 8th generation of the Intel i3 line. They're priced similarly to the Ryzen 3 line, and they have four true cores as well. In fact, they show similar if not better performance in most categories. 

Unfortunately, the lowest-priced motherboards available for this chip at this time are all over $100. This makes it hard to consider them a "budget gaming CPU". 

Until cheaper motherboards are released for the new line of Intel CPUs, Ryzen 3 will remain our budget CPU of choice.

## Is an SSD Worth the Money? 

SSDs are quite pricey, especially compared to mechanical drives. For example, a 240GB SSD will cost you around $60, while a 1TB mechanical drive costs $50. 

So, are they really worth it? 

*YES*. Yes they are. 

SSDs are much faster than mechanical drives. If you buy a 240GB SSD, you can store your Windows OS, drivers, and some of your favorite games on it. Your PC's boot speeds will dramatically increase – furthermore, the overall compuer's usability is better, too. 

If you have evert felt like you need to let your PC 'warm up' after turning it on, you probably have a mechanical drive. With an SSD, you won't have to wait anymore!

Seriously, your PC will be ready to go within 30 seconds of hitting the power button. It's no joke! 

In addition, games installed on your SSD will load incredibly quickly. You'll be among the first loaded in the game! 

Of course, 240GB is not a lot of storage if you like to download photos, music, movies, applications, etc. For your mass storage, you can buy a 1TB mechanical hard drive. They're cheap, and work perfectly for regular file storage. 

*If you have the money for an SSD, buy one! They make your user experience 100x better!*

## Custom vs. Prebuilt Gaming PCs

Most prebuilt gaming PCs come with a powerful CPU, like an Intel i7. They have lots of RAM and a huge hard drive. Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you the truth. 

What truth? 

Those things don't matter. They put crappy components in a nice case and market it as a "gaming PC". 

Well, we have news for you. These overpriced and underpowered prebuilt "gaming PCs" don't deserve the title. Video games aren't really processed by the CPU. In fact, they're processed by the GPU. The GPU is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering and graphical processing. Hence the name "Graphics Processing Unit". 

As long as your CPU is fast enough to keep up with the GPU, you're in good shape. This means you can save some money and buy a cheaper CPU. With the money you saved, spend it on a more powerful GPU. Your powerful GPU will handle all of the 3D rendering in game, resulting in great FPS.

However, this doesn't mean you can buy the cheapest CPU on the market. If your CPU is too underpowered, it'll hold back the GPU. This is called *bottlenecking*.

Anyway, back to the parts of a prebuilt gaming PC. Remember how I told you the GPU does all of the heavy lifting? Well, if you bought a prebuilt desktop with an Intel i7 and a GTX 750, you're out of luck.

Fortunately in 2018 *there are some viable prebuilt options*. You have to know what you're looking for, but if you buy the right PC you can actually make your money go a long way. 

Crytpocurrency miners want GPUs, not gaming PCs. This is why prebuilt PCs have maintained relatively the same (low) price.
