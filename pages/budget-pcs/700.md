## The Phoenix 

This build is named the Phoenix for a reason. If you know anything about a phoenix, then you know they're awesome, as is this gaming PC. It's the best gaming PC under $700. 

It's sporting a [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5){:target="_blank"} which is a quad-core CPU with simultaneous multithreading. 

This means it has 8 threads which is awesome for gaming and much more. If you want to record, edit pictures and videos, stream etc. this CPU can do it all. 

It also has a [GTX 1060 6GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IPVSLTC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IPVSLTC&linkId=732291cfa0ea4c1484fc72ca80483f10){:target="_blank"}, great for gaming in 1080p and beyond. You'll see 60+ FPS with high-ultra settings in nearly all titles. 

You can expect to see 100+ FPS in competitive eSports titles like CS:GO and LOL. We know every frame counts, as it can be the difference between a win and a loss. 

The main purpose of this PC is gaming, and the parts were picked accordingly.  I'd like to address two things. 

First of all, I chose 8GB of RAM for this build. I know some newer games are recommending 12GB and even 16GB of ram. I also know that right now, RAM prices are through the roof. When push comes to shove, the GPU is far more important than RAM.  

Furthermore, *8GB of RAM is still plenty for a gaming PC under $700.* You won't suffer a notable loss of performance in-game. Most importantly of all, with the money you save on RAM you'll be able to spend on the GPU. From a gaming standpoint, it's the best move. 

Second of all, we skipped the [SSD](http://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd). In a perfect world, we'd be able to fit one in the budget. Ideally, you'd load your Windows OS and drivers onto the SSD, and a some of your favorite games. 

Even though an SSD provides faster loading times, it doesn't actually have any performance in-game. Sure, your loading times would be much lower, but this doesn't mean your framerates will be higher, nor does it mean you'll be able to turn up your graphics. 

Since this PC was designed with gaming performance in mind, we skipped the SSD. If you have the extra money, you can probably pick up a 120GB SSD for $50. That's enough for Windows and some of your favorite games. We recommend [Kingston SSDs](http://amzn.to/2EjhbWR){:target="_blank"}, as they're affordable and high quality. 

Don't worry about the hard drive in the build being slow. It revolves 7200 times per minute, much faster than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Overall, it's a great 700 dollar gaming PC build. As of right now, it may be a bit over $700, as the price of RAM and GPUs are through the roof. Have no fear, they'll level off soon. 

## Custom vs. Prebuilt Gaming PCs

Most prebuilt gaming PCs come with a powerful CPU, like an Intel i7. They have lots of RAM and a huge hard drive. Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you the truth. 

What truth? 

Those things don't matter. They put crappy components in a nice case and market it as a "gaming PC". 

Well, we have news for you. These overpriced and underpowered prebuilt "gaming PCs" don't deserve the title. Video games aren't really processed by the CPU. In fact, they're processed by the GPU. The GPU is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering and graphical processing. Hence the name "Graphics Processing Unit". 

As long as your CPU is fast enough to keep up with the GPU, you're in good shape. This means you can save some money and buy a cheaper CPU. With the money you saved, spend it on a more powerful GPU. Your powerful GPU will handle all of the 3D rendering in game, resulting in great FPS. 

However, this doesn't mean you can buy the cheapest CPU on the market. If your CPU is too underpowered, it'll hold back the GPU. This is called *bottlenecking*.

Anyway, back to the parts of a prebuilt gaming PC. Remember how I told you the GPU does all of the heavy lifting? Well, if you bought a prebuilt desktop with an Intel i7 and a GTX 750, you're out of luck. 

## A Prebuilt Gaming PC Under $700 
<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH"><img class="img-middle" src="/img/case/xtreme.png" /></a>


Though most prebuilt gaming PCs are a ripoff, there are some viable prebuilt options. In this section, we're going to be taking a look at the best prebuilt gaming PC for $700. *Note that prices fluctuate daily.*

We think the [Cyberpower Gamer Xtreme VR](http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH){:target="_blank"} is the best prebuilt gaming PC for the money. 

**Let's take a look at the specs:** 

* Intel Core i5-7400 3.0GHz Quad-Core Processor
* 8GB DDR4 RAM
* 1TB HDD
* AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB
* Windows 10 

For $700, you're getting a PC with a 7th generation i5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and an RX 580 4GB, not to mention a full version of Windows 10. 

This is a great deal, considering you're also getting the PC prebuilt and shipped to your door. It comes in an awesome case too! 

You can expect to see 60+ FPS in most new titles with this PC, running at high-ultra settings.

### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-small .img-right}


A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5) is a great budget gaming CPU. It is able to hold its own in CPU intensive games such as Arma and ARK Survival, while also keeping up with high end GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1070 without bottlenecking.

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400

## Intel i3 vs. Ryzen 3 

Up until recently, it was obvious that AMD's Ryzen 3 line held the title of "The King of Budget Gaming CPUs". Before Ryzen 3 was released, your only real options were the skylake i3 CPUs, or the Pentium G4560. Both choices didn't sport four cores; only dual cores with hyperthreading. 

At the time they were great, as the four threads did a great job. Of course, once AMD launched a quad core CPU for a lower price, it was game over. AMD's Ryzen line outperformed Intel's closest offerings in just about every category except for single-threaded performance. 

As we all expected, Intel fought back. They released their Coffe Lake CPUs, the 8th generation of the Intel i3 line. They're priced similarly to the Ryzen 3 line, and they have four true cores as well. In fact, they show similar if not better performance in most categories. 

Unfortunately, the lowest-priced motherboards available for this chip at this time are all over $100. This makes it hard to consider them a "budget gaming CPU". 

Until cheaper motherboards are released for the new line of Intel CPUs, Ryzen 3 will remain our budget CPU of choice.

### Step 1: Find an old desktop for sale on eBay

The first step to building a dirt cheap gaming PC is finding an old desktop on eBay.

You're going to have to filter through lots of desktops. This may take some time. 

I'd recommend using eBay filters. Often you can find a listing that is advertised as "for parts or repair".

Many think that just because their PC won't power on, it's garbage. Little do they know, there are many parts inside the PC that can be salvaged. This will help you to save lots of money. 

Finding an old used desktop is also a good path to take.

After 10 minutes or so of browsing eBay listings, I found this PC for sale. 

The PC is listed for $150 which is a pretty good price, but we'll get this PC for even less. 

Make sure the PC doesn't have anything wrong with it, and check out the specs of the PC. 

This Dell Optiplex 990 MT PC has: 

* Intel Core i7-2600 3.4 GHz CPU
* 8GB of DDR3 Ram
* 500GB Hard Drive
* DVD-Rom 

Furthermore, you're getting the case, power supply, and motherboard all for the low price of $150. Now it's time for the next step.

### Step 2: Negotiate a Price

The price of this PC is already low, but we want it even lower. 

Most listings allow you to make a "Best Offer". It's always a good idea to negotiate for a lower price.

Once a price is agreed upon, make the purchase. Now we move on to our third and final step. 

### Step 3: Buy a GPU 

The GPU is the most important part of any gaming PC. You really don't need the best processor to game. You don't even need a ton of ram. The GPU does all of the hard work. 

This is why we purchased an older desktop PC and salvaged the parts. The older components are still more than capable of gaming. As long as the CPU won't bottleneck, you're good to go. 

That being said, finding the right GPU is important. 

Return to eBay, and search for your GPU of choice. For this example, we'll use the [GeForce GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MF7EQJZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MF7EQJZ&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=b30aa04fcbfda1074ebc6672538b4918){:target="_blank"}. This GPU is powerful, cheap, and great for a low end budget.

Don't be afraid to buy a used GPU. I've bought many used GPUs on eBay with no problem at all. Just read the reviews of the seller and make sure they're trusted. 

Once you find your GPU for sale on eBay, repeat the last step and await your parts to arrive! 

There you have it, a cheap gaming PC!
