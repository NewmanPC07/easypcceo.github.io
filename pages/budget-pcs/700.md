### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-medium .img-right}
A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5) is a great budget gaming CPU. It is able to hold its own in CPU intensive games such as Arma and ARK Survival, while also keeping up with high end GPUs like the GeForce GTX 1070 without bottlenecking. 
Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Cores: 4
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (8 Threads)

In the past few years, Intel has been the choice for nearly all gamers. In recent months, AMD has come out with a new line of processors: Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5. 

While Ryzen 7 is a bit overkill most gamers, the Ryzen 5 line is an outstanding choice. The price to performance from a Ryzen 5 processor is absolutely unbelievable. In fact, they often outperform many of Intel's CPUs.

### The Motherboard 
![ASRock AB350M](/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png "ASRock AB350M"){: .img-medium .img-right}
Deciding which motherboard is right for you can be a daunting task. 

With many things to consider such as chipset, socket type, ram slots, PCI-E slots, fan connnectors, etc. it can be a lot to tackle all at once.

Fortunately, we've done all of the heavy lifting for you. 

For this build, the [ASRock - AB350M micro ATX AM4 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9LN3QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06X9LN3QK&linkId=f6f55287ac06445f3097836d1db39bf8) was chosen. It supports 2400 MHz ram, it has onboard USB 3.0 headers, and much more. 

This motherboard pretty much has everything you need in a micro ATX form factor. 

Specs: 

* CPU Socket Type: AM4

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-medium .img-right}

Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B250 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

## The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png  "1TB Hard Drive"){: .img-medium .img-right}

The [WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&linkId=ebd1ec7b7b862a7d17070d2b1ea21b01) is today's standard mass storage drive for good reason. 

1TB of storage is plenty for your OS, drivers, video games, music, videos, etc. Furthermore, this HDD is known for its reliability and dependibility. 

It is a 7200 RPM hard drive, meaning load times are signficantly quicker than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Unfortunately we were not able to include an SSD in this build. However, you can find SSDs on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=solid+state+drive&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) at a low cost.

### The Graphics Card 
![GTX 1060 6GB SC](/img/gpu/gtx1060sc.jpg "GTX 1060 6GB SC"){: .img-medium .img-right}
The GPU is easily the most important part of any gaming rig. Any well optimized PC game will primarily harness the power of your GPU, followed by your CPU and your ram, respectfully. 

For this $700 build, the [GeForce GTX 1060 6GB SC Gaming GPU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IPVSLTC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IPVSLTC&linkId=732291cfa0ea4c1484fc72ca80483f10) was chosen. 

This GPU boasts 6GB of DDR5 memory, dominating in 1080p resolution. This card easily plays new titles in 1080p resolution with max settings, achieving 60fps. 

At a budget like this, the GTX 1070 is preferred, but due to [ethereum mining](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/), the price of this GPU has gone through the roof. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Core Clock: 1.61 GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.83 GHz
* TDP: 120 Watts
* Length: 6.81"
* DVI-D Dual-Link: 1
* Displayport: 3
* HDMI: 1

Miners are trying to get their hands on all of the GPUs they can. Get yours before they're gone.

### The Power Supply
![EVGA 430 Watt](/img/PSU/evga-430.png "EVGA 430 Watt PSU"){: .img-medium .img-right}
This build is power efficient, only consuming 270 watts. This low power consumption is thanks to the low TDP ratings of the parts in the build. 

Not only will this save the planet, it'll save you money on your electricity bill too. 

The [EVGA 430 Watt 80+ certified power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H33SDR4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00H33SDR4&linkId=9380d6567192c5f51a4715e9bf5eb2a7) was chosen for the build. 

A fully modular power supply wasn't in the budget, but this PSU is a great choice. No need for any additional wattage, as there is no room for a second GPU in the build anyway. 

Specs:

* Type: ATX12V / EPS12V
* Wattage: 430 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: No
* Efficiency: 80+
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 1
