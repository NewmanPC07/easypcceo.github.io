## [ARCTIC F12 PWM Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="Arctic F12 pwm pst case fan" src="/img/case-fans/arctic-f12-pwm.jpg" /></a>

**1.** The [ARCTIC F12 PWM PST case fan](https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb){: target="_blank"} was designed to run quietly, while improving airflow and ventilation. 

Your computer's motherboard utilizes the F12's PWM function to run the fan at the right speed at all times. This feature ensures your PC will be at the proper temperature. Moreover, because your fan won't be running faster than necessary, the PWM feature also helps to reduce noise. 

The fan is also reversible – in other words, you can install it in a manner that will either draw cool air into your case (intake) or push warm air out of your case (exhaust). 

The fan housing is actually two seperate sections, connected together with rubber grommets to help suppress the noise from vibrations. 

*What's the bottom line here?*

If you're looking for a cheap, quiet, and cool fan, the Arctic F12 PWM is a great choice.

**2.** The [Cooler Master JetFlo 120 case fan](https://amzn.to/2KYMRHa){: target="_blank"} is ultra-thin, but don't underestimate its cooling power. 

The blades spin from 800 to 2,000 RPM, thanks to the fan's high performance motor. The fan's blades generate  up to 95 CFM airflow. 

Cooler Master's self-lubricating polyoxymethelene (POM) bearing gives this fan a lifespan of around 160,000 hours. You're definitely getting your money's worth out of this purchase. 

You can choose from red, white, blue, and non-LED fans to match your PC's color scheme. Overall, this fan is delivering performance, style, and superb airflow, all for a low price. 

At 1200 RPM with the included silent mode adapter, this fan emits 19 dBa. At 1600 RPM this fan emits 28 dBa.

The corners of this fan are made of rubber, bolted to the fan's frame. This features cuts down on fan vibrations and helps to eliminate noise.

**3.** Although this fan may look plain, it is actually far from it. The [Noctua NF-F12 case fan](https://amzn.to/2L2nH7b){: target="_blank"} is designed with the new Focused Flow frame to achieve the perfect balance between cooling performance and quietness. 

Integrated Anti-Vibration pads help to reduce noise, even when the Noctua NF-F12's 7 fans are spinning at full speed (1500 RPM). The fan ships with a low-noise adapter, which reduces the fan's maximum speed from 1500 RPM to 1200 RPM. 

The NF-F12 uses Noctua's brand new SSO2 bearing. The rear magnet has been moved closer to the axis to deliver increased stability during operation. 

The bearing shell of the fan is constructed entirely with brass – this fan is built to last. 

Despite this fan's affordable price, it is one of Noctua's high performance fans, guarunteed to deliver fantastic airflow without making a lot of noise.

**4.** The [Corsair ML120 Pro LED case fan](https://amzn.to/2ufREJM){: target="_blank"} has a magnetic bearing that keeps the fan quiet, in addition to prolonging the fan's life span, and helping its performance overall. 

Its custom rotor design provides a balance between high airflow and static pressure. You can control the fan's speed, all the way up to 2,400 RPM. In addition, the colors of the fan are entirely customizable.

If you're searching for a case fan that is capable of cooling even the hottest computers, look no further. If I had to describe the [NZXT FN V2 case fan](https://amzn.to/2u9tLEF){: target="_blank"} with one word, it would be performance. 

The fan is rated at 50 CFM, and can spin at a rate of 1,000 RPM. The fan is quiet, only emiting 21 dBa. It comes in black and white. 

The fan ships with sleeved cables and anti-vibration pads to increase performance and minimize noise during operation. 

The fan is designed to last for a long time – actually, NZXT insures your purchase with a two-year warranty. 

For a 140mm fan, the FN V2 is incredibly light, weighing in at 5.1 ounces. 

For a mere $12, you can't beat the price/performance of this 140mm case fan. 

## [Corsair Air Series AF140 Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Corsair Air Series AF140" src="/img/case-fans/corsair-af140.png" /></a>

The [Corsair Air Series AF140 Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq){: target="_blank"} really packs a punch for less than $15. 

Spinning at 1200 RPM and only emiting 25.5 dBa, the AF140 is capable of regulating your PC's internal temperature without making too much noise. 

It's rated at 66.4 CFM, and Corsair recommends at least 3cm of clearance between the fan and anything else inside your case to insure the best possible airflow. 

You fan features LED lighting, and a variety of colors to choose from, including red, blue, white, and purple. The fan's blades are translucent and frosted, which creates a cool effect when the LEDs are turned on and the fan is spinning. 

The AF140 is an ultra-thin, powerful, good looking and cheap 140mm case fan. It's a yes from me! 

## [Corsair ML140 Pro LED Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="Corsair ML140 Case fan" src="/img/case-fans/corsair-ml140.png" /></a>

The [Corsair ML140 Pro LED case fan](https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj){: target="_blank"} has custom LEDs mounted to the center harness of the fan, which give off extremely vibrant color. You can choose from white, blue or red LEDs. 

Anti-vibration pads keep the fan quiet, even at top speed (1600 RPM). 

Corsair's Advanced Magnetic Levitation bearing sets this fan apart from the competition. The bearing dramatically reduces friction by magnetically levitating the fan blade, which prolongs the fan's life and lowers noise levels. 

You can dynamically control the fan's speed from 400 RPM all the way up to 1,200 RPM to minimize noise or maximize airflow. 

I use these case fans in my PC, and I've never had any issues. They might work a bit too well!
