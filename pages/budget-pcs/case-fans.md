## [ARCTIC F12 PWM Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="Arctic F12 pwm pst case fan" src="/img/case-fans/arctic-f12-pwm.jpg" /></a>

**1.** The [ARCTIC F12 PWM PST case fan](https://amzn.to/2m8zQNb){: target="_blank"} was designed to run quietly, while improving airflow and ventilation. 

Your computer's motherboard utilizes the F12's PWM function to run the fan at the right speed at all times. This feature ensures your PC will be at the proper temperature. Moreover, because your fan won't be running faster than necessary, the PWM feature also helps to reduce noise. 

The fan is also reversible – in other words, you can install it in a manner that will either draw cool air into your case (intake) or push warm air out of your case (exhaust). 

The fan housing is actually two separate sections, connected together with rubber grommets to help suppress the noise from vibrations.  

**Features:** 

* Patented PWM Sharing Technology (PST)
* Extremely quiet
* High air flow and static pressure
* Low noise impeller
* Fluid dynamic bearing extends service life

GPUs and CPUs generate an significant amount of heat. Believe it or not, if it weren't for the CPU cooler, you could fry an egg on a CPU while it's operating. 

Most people choose to install many case fans to keep their PC running cool. This option works, but it also generates more noise. With the new ARCTIC PWM fan, you can keep your case cool without generating a lot of noise. 

The fan speed changes according to the system temperatures. The fan's innovative PST feature allows up to five fans (including a CPU fan) to connect to the ARCTIC PWM fan, and all of the fans will run at the same speed as the PWM fan. 

When the system temp rises, all of the fans in the system will run faster to accomodate for the higher temperatures. On the other hand, if the case temperature falls, the fans will slow down, saving energy and emitting less noise. 

*So, what are the main advantages of the ARCTIC F12 PWM fan?*

1. Quiet fans keep your case cool during operation 
2. Saves energy 
3. Control fan speed of different fans with just one PWM signal 

*What's the bottom line here?*

If you're looking for a cheap, quiet, and cool fan, the Arctic F12 PWM is a great choice.

## [Noctua NF-F12 Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2L2nH7b){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2L2nH7b"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Noctua NF-F12 case fan" src="/img/case-fans/noctua-nf-f12.png" /></a>

**3.** Although this fan may look plain, it is actually far from it. The [Noctua NF-F12 case fan](https://amzn.to/2L2nH7b){: target="_blank"} is designed with the new Focused Flow frame to achieve the perfect balance between cooling performance and quietness. 

Integrated Anti-Vibration pads help to reduce noise, even when the Noctua NF-F12's 7 fans are spinning at full speed (1500 RPM). The fan ships with a low-noise adapter, which reduces the fan's maximum speed from 1500 RPM to 1200 RPM. 

The NF-F12 uses Noctua's brand new SSO2 bearing. The rear magnet has been moved closer to the axis to deliver increased stability during operation.

## [NZXT FN V2 Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2u9tLEF){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2u9tLEF"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="NZXT FN V2 Case Fan" src="/img/case-fans/nzxt.png" /></a>

**1.** If you're searching for a case fan that is capable of cooling even the hottest computers, look no further. If I had to describe the [NZXT FN V2 case fan](https://amzn.to/2u9tLEF){: target="_blank"} with one word, it would be performance. 

The fan is rated at 50 CFM, and can spin at a rate of 1,000 RPM. The fan is quiet, only emitting 21 dBa. It comes in black and white. 

The fan ships with sleeved cables and anti-vibration pads to increase performance and minimize noise during operation. 

The fan is designed to last for a long time – actually, NZXT ensures your purchase with a two-year warranty. 

Despite being a 140mm fan, the FN V2 is incredibly light, weighing in at 5.1 ounces. 

For a mere $12, you can't beat the price/performance of this 140mm case fan. 

## [Corsair Air Series AF140 Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Corsair Air Series AF140" src="/img/case-fans/corsair-af140.png" /></a>

**2.** The [Corsair Air Series AF140 case fan](https://amzn.to/2ubsRaq){: target="_blank"} really packs a punch for less than $15. 

Spinning at 1200 RPM and only emitting 25.5 dBa, the AF140 is capable of regulating your PC's internal temperature without making too much noise. 

It's rated at 66.4 CFM, and Corsair recommends at least 3cm of clearance between the fan and anything else inside your case to ensure the best possible airflow. 

The fan features LED lighting, and a variety of colors to choose from, including red, blue, white, and purple. The fan's blades are translucent and frosted, which creates a cool effect when the LEDs are turned on and the fan is spinning. 

The AF140 is an ultra-thin, powerful, good-looking and cheap 140mm case fan. It's a yes from me! 

## [Corsair ML140 Pro LED Case Fan](https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="Corsair ML140 Case fan" src="/img/case-fans/corsair-ml140.png" /></a>

**3.** The [Corsair ML140 Pro LED case fan](https://amzn.to/2J8xRBj){: target="_blank"} has custom LEDs mounted to the center harness of the fan that gives off extremely vibrant colors. You can choose from white, blue or red LEDs. 

Anti-vibration pads keep the fan quiet, even at top speed (1200 RPM). 

Corsair's Advanced Magnetic Levitation bearing sets this fan apart from the competition. The bearing dramatically reduces friction by magnetically levitating the fan blade, which prolongs the fan's life and lowers noise levels. 

You can dynamically control the fan's speed from 400 RPM all the way up to 1,200 RPM to minimize noise or maximize airflow. 

I use these case fans in my PC, and I've never had any issues. They might work a bit too well! 

## What to Look for in Your Next Case Fans

Before you buy your next set of case fans, it's important to consider the following:

* **Size** – The size of your fans matter. The most commonly used case fan sizes are 80mm, 120mm, and 140mm. If possible, buy 140mm case fans, as they provide the best airflow at lower RPMs (since they're the biggest, they push more air at the same RPM as a smaller fan.)

* **Noise** – If you're anything like me, noisy case fans drive you insane. Noise level is especially important if you want to make YouTube videos or stream to Twitch. You definitely don't want noisy case fans. 

* **Airflow** – This one is obvious, so I'm not going to go into detail about it – just make sure your fans provide adequate airflow.

* **Type of Power Connector** - Fans that connect to the motherboard usually have 2 Pins. The 3 Pin fans have a tachometer signal that allows the motherboard to read the fan’s RPMs, and the 4 Pin connector fans have PWM signal for speed control. Also, make sure your motherboard has enough fan connectors to accommodate all of your fans. 

* **Cosmetics** – Lastly, you'll want to make sure your fans look cool! There are many different designs to choose from. Don't be afraid to search until you find the right fans for you. 

## Best PC Fan for Gaming 

Although some companies advertise their fans as 'gaming fans,' they aren't any different from regular fans. 

I'd recommend choosing one of the fans listed above, either 120mm or 140mm in size, because they are the best PC case fans money can buy. 

If you want, choose fans that come with LEDs, as that's really the only difference between regular case fans and 'gaming fans.' 

## How to Install Case Fans

</div>

## The Importance of Case Fans 

Case fans are important because the components inside your PC generate *a lot* of heat. If you didn't have a CPU cooler on your CPU, for example, you could fry an egg on top of it. Seriously, look it up. 

If your components get too hot, it can damage them and shorten their lifespan. You'll run into problems with your components malfunctioning if they get too hot. 

Most components are programmed to automatically shut down if they get too hot to avoid damage. So, either your PC will turn off over and over, or your components will be damaged. 

CPUs and GPUs run especially hot – it is crucial that your PC draws in cool air and expels the warm air. 

An efficient cooling system can increase the performance and the lifespan of your computer.

## 120mm Case Fans vs. 140mm Case Fans 

So, if you have the option to choose either 120mm or 140mm case fans, which is best? 

In almost every scenario, you should choose 140mm case fans. 

**Here's why:**

140mm fans are larger than 120mm fans (obviously). Therefore, they can move more air, even at a lower RPM. They can spin slower (and more quietly), while achieving the same cooling. 

Or, you can have them spin faster and produce even more air. 

The only time you should use 120mm case fans over 140mm is if your case can hold more 120mm fans than 140mm fans. 

Cases that have space for a 240mm radiator are also an exception – in that case, it'd be wise to mount two 120mm case fans.
