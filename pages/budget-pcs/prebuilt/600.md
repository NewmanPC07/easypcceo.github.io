## [Best Prebuilt Gaming PC Under 600 Dollars: Dell Inspiron 5675](https://amzn.to/2N3nWzV){: target="_blank"} 

I built my first gaming computer when I was in the 8th grade, so it's safe to say I love building gaming computers. 

However, building a custom gaming PC isn't for everyone. If you'd rather buy a prebuilt gaming PC, you can't go wrong with the [Dell Inspiron 5675](https://amzn.to/2N3nWzV){: target="_blank"}. 

**Let's take a look at the specs:**

This gaming PC is capable of running all new titles in 1080p resolution with respectable framerates and graphical settings. 

For just $600, you're getting a powerful Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 [RAM](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-ram/){: target="_blank"}, an [HDD](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152){: target="_blank"} with 1TB of storage and a powerful graphics card with 4GB of dedicated DDR5 [VRAM](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/video-RAM){: target="_blank"}. 

Now for the more detailed guide: 

### Processor 
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-right .img-small}

This prebuilt PC is rocking a Ryzen 5 1400, one of my favorite 'bang for your PC gaming buck' processors. 

This quad-core CPU has multithreading enabled, which means the [CPU](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-a-cpu/){: target="_blank"} really has 8 cores. AMD's multithreading is basically their version of Intel's hyperthreading. 

Since the CPU has eight threads and four physical cores, it effectively has eight cores (four of which are physical and four of which are theoretical). 

It's important to keep in mind that you don't need an incredibly expensive or powerful processor for gaming, especially if you're on a budget. 

Most well optimized games primarily harness the power of the computer's GPU (graphics processing unit) which handles 3D rendering. Of course, the CPU is the brain of the computer, so it still plays a part when it comes to gaming related tasks. 

However, since video games mainly use the power of the GPU, you'll have better gaming performance if you purchase a powerful GPU, and a less powerful CPU. 

As long as the CPU doesn't bottleneck (limit the power of the GPU) you'll be okay. I can assure you that the Ryzen 5 1400 is more than fit for the task, and it won't bottleneck the GPU in this build.

The Ryzen 5 1400 is less than $150, yet it has four physical cores, eight threads, and impressive overclocking performance. Not only does it excell when it comes to gaming, it can also be used for recording, streaming, editing, rendering, etc. Overall, it's an excellent CPU. 

### RAM 

Several years ago, you could get away with 4GB of RAM for gaming. Nowadays, 8GB is the bare minimum – some games are even starting to recommend 12GB to 16GB of RAM. 

Keep in mind, however, that having more than 8GB of RAM is only ideal if you plan on playing games with maxed out settings in 1080p or 1440p. 

I have 8GB of DDR4 2400MHz RAM in my build, and it works well. In 2018, 8GB is still plenty for 1080p gaming with respectable framerates and good graphics. 

![RAM Cover](/img/ram/ram-cover.jpg){: .img-middle}

This build features 8GB of DDR4 2400MHz RAM, which pairs well with the Ryzen 5 1400. RAM speed seems to have a significant impact on Ryzen processors' performance. I'd recommend at least 2400 MHz of DDR4 RAM for a Ryzen chip. 

Luckily, 2400 MHz RAM is included in this prebuilt gaming PC, and it can always be overclocked to higher frequencies. Moreover, you can always add more RAM to the build if you want to in the future. That's the beauty of PC gaming: unlike consoles, you have the freedom to tweak and modify your build to your liking, without having to wait for the release of the next Xbox or PlayStation. 

Some applications, such as Google Chrome, use a significant amount of RAM. Sometimes when I'm playing a game that needs more RAM than usual, I have to close my Google Chrome tabs for maximum performance. It's not really much of an issue, but I thought it was something worth noting. 

If you want to have Google Chrome open while gaming (if you have a dual monitor setup, for example) then you should purchase additional RAM. Otherwise, 8GB is more than enough. 

### Graphics Card (GPU)
![Radeon RX 570 GPU](/img/gpu/radeon-rx-570.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

The graphics card is easily the most important part of any gaming PC. Games are optimized to rely heavily on the GPU, as it is responsible for 3D rendering. 

With that being said, it's safe to say a GPU can make or break a gaming PC. 

This PC is equipped with a powerful [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit){: target="_blank"} from AMD: the Radeon RX 570 4GB. 

Although the RX 570 doesn't have the computational power of an RX 580 or a GTX 1070, it still packs a punch. It has 4GB of dedicated DDR5 VRAM, and a core clock of 1168 MHz. 

The RX 570 is not powerful enough to max out every game with 1080p ultra settings, but you can't really expect that on a $600 budget. 

However, you will be able to play just about every new title in 1080p with a mix of medium-high settings while achieving playable framerates (60+ FPS). 

You can't ask for more with $600 – furthermore, you can always upgrade your graphics card in the future. 

### Storage 
![storage wd caviar blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png){: .img-right .img-small}

This PC ships with a 1TB, 7200RPM mechanical hard drive. This is plenty of space for all of your programs, movies, music, files, and of course, games. 

Thankfully, this PC's hard drive is 7200RPM, as opposed to 5400RPM. For those of you who don't know, RPM (revolutions per minute) is a measurement of the disc's rotation speed, which has a direct impact on transfer speed. 

In today's day and age, anything less than 7200RPM is ridiculously slow, especially now that we have affordable SSDs and even M.2 storage solutions. 

1TB of mass storage is great – although, the PC is missing an SSD (Solid State Drive). 

*Do you need an SSD in your gaming PC?*

Technically, no, you don't. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy one. 

I didn't understand how awesome SSDs are until I bought one for my rig. If you have your OS (Windows), drivers, and a few games loaded on your SSD as opposed to a traditional mechanical drive, the difference is night and day. 

When my Windows OS was installed on my mechanical drive, my PC took several minutes to start. Moreover, once it had finally booted up, I felt like I had to let the computer "warm up" because all of my files and programs were still loading. 

Once I bought an SSD and installed Windows on it, my PC cold booted in 30 seconds, and it was immediately responsive. I installed a few games on the SSD as well, and I'm always the first one to load into the map. It's awesome! 

You can pick up a 240GB SSD for around $50 these days, which is pretty affordable. It's not enough space for everything, but it's more than enough for Windows, and a few of your favorite games. Everything else (movies, music, programs, and other files) can be stored on your mechanical hard drive. 

This PC is missing the SSD, but that doesn't mean you can't add one! 

If you are going to get an SSD, I'd highly recommend the [Samsung 860 EVO 250GB 2.5 Inch SATA III](https://amzn.to/2wh9oW6){: target="_blank"} internal SSD. I have it in my PC, and I absolutely love it. 

### Windows 10 Included

In addition to getting a bunch of awesome parts, this PC also ships with Windows 10 already installed. 

If you were to build your own gaming PC, you'd have to spend an additional $50 on the software, and you'd have to spend time installing it. 

Buying this prebuilt gaming computer not only saves you time, it also saves you money. 

## 7 Games Tested 

The video below shows 7 different games tested with a gaming PC that has the same specs as this prebuilt. This isn't my footage, nor was it captured with the same prebuilt PC. However, your framerates will be similar, as the test rig was using a Ryzen 5 1400 and an RX 570 4GB. 

All of the games were tested with the settings cranked all the way up. Some of the games in the test were running at 40 FPS. If you are willing to turn the settings down to high/medium, you'll easily be able to achieve 60 FPS.
