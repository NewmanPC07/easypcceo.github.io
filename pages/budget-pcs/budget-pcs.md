## Choosing Parts for Your First Gaming PC 

![First Gaming PC Infographic](/img/infographic/first-gaming-pc-infographic.png)

## The Full Guide

This is where we get extremely in depth. We're going to cover everything you could possibly want to know about gaming PCs. You can scroll down a bit to find a table of contents which outlines the guide, section by section. 

We know buying a gaming PC isn't always easy, especially if it is your first time around. It can be overwhelming to figure out what parts to buy, especially if you need to make a little bit of money go a long way. 

Furthermore, once you buy the parts, then you actually have to build the computer! 

Or do you? 

We'll talk about all of that and more very soon. 

## Why Build a Gaming PC? 

Many have grown accustomed to coming home, sitting down and turning on their console. It's easy and convenient, but is it the best option? 

The answer is no. 

PC gaming has MANY benefits that consoles simply lack. In fact, there is NOTHING a console can do that a gaming PC cannot. If a console can do it, a PC can do it better.

![Sweet Setup](/img/misc/setup.jpg)

A console can play video games, and maybe watch Netflix. A gaming PC can perform these tasks at higher resolutions, framerates, and graphical settings. 

Moreover, this PC is more than just a gaming machine. Unlike a console, your gaming PC can edit videos, pictures, code, stream, record, surf the web, etc.

But to enjoy all of these things, you have to spend a ton of money, right? 

**WRONG!**

Many mistakenly believe that you have to spend at least $1000 to have any sort of enjoyment from gaming on a PC. 

This is the furthest from the truth, as you can EASILY achieve 60fps at 1080p resolutions with a [$500,](/budget-pcs/500/) or even a [$400](/budget-pcs/400/) gaming PC. Building a dirt cheap gaming PC has never been easier.

## Viable Prebuilt Option 

![Inspiron-3650](/img/misc/prebuilt/inspiron-3650.png){: .img-middle}

Though many prebuilt gaming PCs aren't worth the time or the money, there are some viable prebuilt options on the market. 

If you know what you're looking for, you can find some great prebuilt alternatives. 

Can you build a budget prebuilt gaming pc? 

The answer is yes.

The [Dell Inspiron i3650](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019TTJD6O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B019TTJD6O&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=7358f2b08c37a9408ad50c9dccf20277){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"} is a great option.

You can find the PC on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019TTJD6O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B019TTJD6O&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=7358f2b08c37a9408ad50c9dccf20277){:target="_blank"} for just $340. 

The PC features: 

* Intel Core i3-6100 
* 8GB DDR3 Ram
* 1TB Hard Drive

This PC comes without a GPU. Don't worry, this problem is easily solved. 

There are lots of powerful and cheap GPUs for sale on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=GeForce+GTX+1050+ti+&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}. You can easily find a GTX 1050 ti used on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=GeForce+GTX+1050+ti+&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"} for a low cost. 

After you purchase the prebuilt desktop and the GPU, you're getting a very capable gaming machine for around $500 or less. This PC can easily game at 1080p. 

If you don't like this case, you can always buy another one and transfer the components. Check out our guide on the [smallest atx cases!](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/)

In my experience, FX Gaming Computers are also a solid prebuilt option. Their [custom gaming computers](https://www.fxcustompc.com/){: target="_blank"} are fast, reliable, and affordable. The coolest part about the company is they'll assemble a prebuilt gaming PC for you, but you get to choose every component from the case to the motherboard. 

<figure> 
	<img src="/img/case/custom-pc.png" alt="Custom Gaming Computer" class="img-middle">
	<figcaption><p>One of FX Custom PC's gaming computers.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

They even offer 12 month interest-free payments on all of their gaming PCs, which is great for those of you on a budget wanting to build a custom PC.

## Advantages of PC Gaming 

PC gaming has many advantages over console gaming. After all, they don't call us the PC Master Race for nothing. We're going to illustrate some of the many **pros of PC gaming**. Keep reading, as some of them may not very obvious. 

### Better Graphics/Framerates

PC gaming will *always* have superior graphics and framerates than consoles. PCs can game in true 1080p, 1440p, and even 4K with over 60 frames per second and 16x MSAA. 

Consoles can only game in 1080p and in some cases 720p. Usually the games' resolutions are upscaled, meaning most games aren't in true 1080p. In addition, it's rare that consoles game in true 60 fps. 

*Why do PCs have superior graphics/framerates?* 

All consoles have the exact same hardware inside. Game developers are aware of the hardware in the consoles, and they can optimize their games to run smoothly on said hardware. 

This is why when you buy a console game, you don't have to worry about being able to run it. You can just pop the disc in your Xbox and start playing. 

On the flip side, developers don't know what's in your PC, as every PC is a bit different. That being said, they can't optimize their game to run smoothly on your PC. Instead, they release a beautiful game and require you to meet certain spec requirements. 

If you have good hardware in your rig, you'll be able to play the games with higher graphics and resolutions. If you want to, you can buy the most expensive hardware (or at least higher end hardware) and run the games with extreme settings. 

With consoles, you're limited to default settings and graphics which are much worse than on the PC. 

### Flexibility 

PC gaming is also much more flexible than console. Consoles all ship the same. They look the same and they perform the same. 

PCs are all unique. They perform differently and you can design your PC exactly the way you want it. 

In addition, if a part of your PC breaks, you can cheaply replace that part. However, if a part in a console breaks, you can't just buy a replacement part. Rather, you have to buy an entirely brand new console. 

If you want to upgrade your PC in the future, that option is also available to you. If you own a console and want to upgrade, your options are quite limited. 

For any substantial improvement, you'll have to wait for the next line of consoles. As you know, Sony and Microsoft waited many years between the PS3/Xbox 360 and the PS4/Xbox One. 

With PC, you have the ability to choose when, what, and how. Choosing your case is a perfect example. With so many options available, you can show your personality with the case you decide to house your parts with! 

For more information on cases, check out our guide on the [smallest ATX cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/)!

### PC Exclusives 

PC has so many amazing games which cannot be found on console. Games like Counter Strike, Rust, PUBG, Star Citizen, and more. Steam also has a diverse selection of free to play games, such as Team Fortress 2. 

Even games that can be played on console are better on the PC. The gameplay is more fluid and dynamic. 

### The Keyboard and Mouse
![Keyboard](/img/misc/keyboard.jpg)

Console controllers are awesome for kicking it on the couch with your buddies and playing casual video games. However, there's a reason why consoles games have aim assist and PC games don't. 

A keyboard and mouse is much easier to use than a controller, especially if you're playing a competitive shooter. 

Some gaming mice feature over 16000 DPI. They can accurately trace every little movement. Joysticks don't allow the same precision. While it can be a bit tricky to master at first, using a keyboard and mouse is far superior to a controller. Check out our guide about [gaming mice](/gaming-mouse/)! 

If you want the benefits of PC but you're still in love with your controller, you can easily plug your controller into your PC or buy an adapter and use your Xbox or PS4 controller with your PC. 

However, if you choose to go this route and you play competitive shooters, other players using the keyboard and mouse will most likely beat you. We recommend using the keyboard and mouse. 

### Cheaper in the Long Run 

Most people believe it costs a fortune to be a PC gamer. Fortunately, this is the farthest from the truth. You can build a brand new gaming PC for just $400. If you buy used parts and you know where to look, you can build one for just $200. 

That being said, it doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, there are other hidden benefits as well. 

First of all, unlike Xbox Live, you don't need to pay for steam. The membership is free. 

Speaking of Steam, they have *amazing* deals. The Steam Summer and Winter sales are absolutely insane. You can find popular AAA titles at least 50% off. There are also lots of fun [free to play games](https://www.pcinvasion.com/the-best-free-pc-games){:target="_blank"}. 

There are also websites such as [G2A.com](https://www.g2a.com/){:target="_blank"} where you can find games even cheaper than Steam. If you account for these factors, PC gaming can easily be cheaper than console gaming over the course of a year or so. 

### Mature Community 

While its possible to build a cheap gaming PC, most believe it's very expensive. On top of this, it can be hard for first time builders to construct their first gaming PC. 

With this in mind, it's easy to understand why most parents buy consoles for their children. Their kids don't have to worry about building the PC or installing drivers, etc. They also think it's cheaper. 

Due to this, most PC gamers are at least in high school if not older. If you're tired of young and annoying kids talking in the microphone and you're looking for a more mature community, PC is the place for you. 

## Console vs. PC

![Awesome Gaming Computer](/img/misc/gamingpc.jpg)

When the Xbox One first launched, a day one edition console was roughly $500. Many of my friends told me they were going to buy an Xbox for $500, a laptop for $500, and an Elgato Game Capture HD for $100. 

They wanted to play video games on their console, record with their Elgato, and edit videos for YouTube with their laptop. 

This may seem like a great idea at first glance. However, there is a **MUCH** better option. 

Instead of spending $1100 in total for the Xbox, laptop, and Elgato, why not spend that money on a gaming PC? 

You don't even have to spend $1100. You could spend anywhere from $400-$1000 on a gaming PC.

Not only does this PC consolidate all of the gaming, recording, editing, streaming, etc. into one place, it also performs all of these tasks more effectively. 

Think about it, an $800 gaming PC can run games at higher resolutions and better framerates than an Xbox. It also is much more powerful than any $500 laptop. PC gaming just makes more sense. 

## How to Find the Right Parts for You

As a PC building noob, it is probably difficult for you to know which parts to buy for your computer. Before you begin looking for components, **ask yourself these simple questions:**

### What is my budget? 
![$](/img/misc/$.png){: .img-right .img-small}


This is always going to be the number one factor when selecting your parts. How much money are you willing to spend on your gaming PC? 

Do you have plenty of money to spend on the PC, or do you need to make a little go a long way? 

If you have a higher budget, you can afford a powerful CPU and GPU such as the Ryzen 5 1600 and the GTX 1070. 

However, if you are on a lower budget, you might want to save money on the CPU and focus more on the GPU to maximize performance per dollar. In this case, I'd go with the Ryzen 3 1200 and a high end GTX 1060. 

Either way, figuring out your budget comes first. I recommend saving your money for a better gaming PC than spending what you have if it's only a small amount. $800 can get you a lot more than $400. Just save the extra money, and be patient. 

However, if you don't have the time to wait, or you can't wait any longer, there are definitely ways for you to build a gaming PC for cheap. 

Now we've arrived at our **second question:**

### What games do I want to play? 

There are so many different games available to you as a prospective PC gamer, it may be hard to wrap your head around it. That being said, some games are demanding, and some games aren't. 

If you want to play games like Terraria, Counter Strike, or Minecraft, you don't need a beefy gaming computer. Most of those games with a low demand for processing power can be played on a dirt cheap gaming PC, or even on a laptop.

However, if you want to play games like [Destiny 2](/game/destiny-2-gaming-pc/), The Witcher 3, GTA V, Rust, etc. you'll need a powerful gaming PC, especially if you want to play with high graphical settings. 

That being said, there's absolutely no reason to spend $1000 on a gaming PC if you'll be playing Minecraft on it all of the time. You can drop $400 on a computer and run Minecraft like a dream. However, if you're looking to play more demanding titles, you'll have to spend a bit more. 

Now that you know what your budget is, you can move on to the next step:

## Finding the Parts for You 

This is often one of the hardest parts of the PC building process; it's also one of the best parts. Unlike consoles, PC provides unlimited flexibility. Not only can you design your PC to be a powerful gaming machine, you can make it look cool too. 

From color schemes of components, to cases, to fans, to LEDs, there is a world of style at your finger tips. Aside from the look and feel of your components, you need to buy powerful components as well. If you're on a tight budget, go for the cheapest CPU that you can and use that money on a nice GPU. 

As long as the CPU doesn't bottleneck the GPU, you won't have to worry about it. This is why the Ryzen 3 1200 usually has no issues being paired with the GTX 1070. For the same price you could pair a Ryzen 5 1400 or 1600 with a GTX 1060. 

However, since gaming heavily relies on the graphics card rather than the CPU, the first combination would see better in-game performance. This is because it has a more powerful graphics card, which is responsible for all of the 3D rendering. 

If you still don't know what parts to get, take a look at one of our five <a href="#overview">budget gaming PC builds.</a>

Also, it's important that you have great case fans to cool your gaming PC. Check out our guide on the [best case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/)!

## Custom Built or Prebuilt? 

There are many prebuilt gaming computers available on the market today. They advertise all the benefits of a gaming PC without any of the hassle. 

Many of these PCs are falsely advertised as great alternatives to a custom build. 

![Best Buy](/img/misc/bestbuy.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}


The manufacturers may include one good part, and cut corners on the rest of the build. It's great for them, as they're making money from ill informed consumers. 

Don't become another dissatisfied customer. It's important to educate yourself before making any purchase, especially when purchasing a gaming PC. 

---

Take a look at the PC below: 

![Best Buy Prebuilt](/img/misc/bestbuy-pc-example.png)

As you can see, this PC is going for nearly $1100 USD. Now let's take a look at what these parts would cost you: 

![Parts vs Prebuilt](/img/misc/parts-vs-prebuilt.jpg)

This prebuilt PC is actually one of the better options out there, and still you can see that it is nearly $200 USD cheaper to build your own PC. 

Most retailers mark up their prices even more dramatically. Evidently, building your own PC is cheaper. 

Customizability is another reason why building your own PC is a good option. You can hand pick your parts, and tailor your PC exactly how you'd like it. 

You can choose your own case, LED color scheme, shape, size, noise level, cooling system, etc. PC building is practically an art form. 

If you only want to play a few games like Overwatch and CSGO for example, you don't have to buy a $1000 gaming PC. Instead, you can get the components you'd need to run those games, and nothing more. 

On the other hand, if you want to play demanding games with the best possible graphics and framerates, you can do that too.

## 8 Things to Consider Before You Buy

![CHEAP PC INFOGRAPHIC](/img/infographic/8-tips-for-budget-pc-building.png)

**[Contact me](/contact/) about using this infographic on your website!**

These 8 methods include:

* Salvaging old parts
* Buying used parts
* Buying a cheap CPU
* Focusing on the GPU
* Looking for deals
* Ask your friends 
* Save money on peripherals and LEDs
* Be patient

Let's take a closer look at each one. 

### Salvaging old parts 

It's easy to buy all of your parts new, but it's also more expensive.

Odds are you probably have an old desktop in your house that still has perfectly good components. 

You could probably salvage an optical drive, hard drive, case, power supply, and sometimes even a motherboard and CPU. 

Even if you don't have an old desktop laying around, you could buy one on eBay. This brings us to our next point. 

[Salvage Old Parts](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=desktop+pc&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: .big-button target="_blank"}

### Buy used parts

Some think you have to buy all new parts to build a great gaming PC. This is simply not true. 

You can look on eBay for used parts that work just as well as new ones. 

The best part?

You're getting the same great components for a lower price! 

### Buy a cheap CPU

If you're on a tight budget, the CPU is where you should save some money. 

Why?

Any well optimized title will harness the power of the GPU over the CPU. As long as your CPU can keep up, you can focus your money on the GPU.

### Focus on the GPU 

As mentioned above, the GPU is the most important part of a gaming PC.

If you're on a budget, you should cut corners elsewhere and focus that money towards buying a powerful GPU. 

We recommend the GTX 1050 ti as the best budget gaming GPU.

### Look for Deals

There are tech deals every day online. It's easy to find them too. 

Nearly all large tech corporations have a newsletter or email alert service.

Simply sign up, and let the emails flow in. More often then not they are notifying you about a great deal. 

You can also negotiate on Craig's List, use a deal finder, coupon codes, etc. 

### Ask Friends

Ask your friends about old PCs they might have laying around. Odds are they have an old computer in their house which is full of great parts. 

If you're lucky, they might have some spare parts they'd be willing to give you either for free or for a reduced price. It's a great way to save money!

### Save Money on Peripherals and LEDs 

Most people want a case full of cool LEDs, a mechanical keyboard with different colors and the best gaming mouse. 

While these things are great additions to a PC gamer's setup, they're NOT necessary. Any mouse and keyboard will do and you don't need LEDs in your case. 

It's much wiser to invest this money in your gaming PC. Later on down the line if you have the money, feel free to invest it in these extra items.

### Be patient 

If you do not have enough money to buy the best parts, that's okay. Just be patient and save your money.

It's better to wait and buy better parts than to impulse buy low end parts that won't do you any good. 

### Gaming from your Bed?

If you'll be using your PC while in bed, be sure to get a comfortable mattress. It's common for gamers who sit or lay down in bed for long periods of time to have back issues, so get the right mattress for a [gamer is important](https://www.sleepsources.com/mattresses/gamers/){: target="_blank"}.
