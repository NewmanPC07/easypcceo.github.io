## Why Build a Gaming PC? 

Many have grown accustomed to coming home, sitting down and turning on their console. It's easy and convenient, but is it the best option? 

The answer is no. 

PC gaming has MANY benefits that consoles simply lack. In fact, there is NOTHING a console can do that a gaming PC cannot. If a console can do it, a PC can do it better.

A console can only play video games, and maybe waching Netflix. A gaming PC can perform these tasks at higher resolutions, framerates, and graphical settings. 

Moreover, this PC is more than just a gaming machine. Unlike a console, your gaming PC can edit videos, pictures, code, stream, record, surf the web, etc.

But to enjoy all of these things, you have to spend a ton of money, right? 

Many mistakenly believe that you have to spend at least $1000 to have any sort of enjoyment from gaming on a PC. 

This is the furthest from the truth, as you can EASILY achieve 60fps at 1080p resolutions easily with a [$500,](/budget-pcs/500/) or even a [$400](/budget-pcs/400/) gaming PC.

When the Xbox One first launched, a day one edition console was roughly $500. Many of my friends told me they were going to buy an Xbox for $500, a laptop for $500, and an Elgato Game Capture HD for $100. 

They wanted to play video games on their console, record with their Elgato, and edit videos for YouTube with their laptop. 

This may seem like a great idea at first glance. However, there is a MUCH better option. 

Instead of spending $1100 in total for the Xbox, laptop, and Elgato, why not spend that money on a gaming PC? 

You don't even have to spend $1100. You could spend anywhere from $500-$1000 on a gaming PC.

Not only does this PC consolidate all of the gaming, recording, editing, streaming, etc. into one place, it also performs all of these tasks more effectively. 

Think about it, an $800 gaming PC can run games at higher resolutions and better framerates than an Xbox. It also is much more powerful than any $500 laptop. PC gaming just makes more sense. 

## Custom Built or Prebuilt? 

There are many prebuilt gaming computers available on the market today. They advertise all the benefits of a gaming PC without any of the hassle. 

Many of these PCs are falsely advertised as great alternatives to a custom build. 

![Best Buy](/img/misc/bestbuy.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}


The manufacturers may include one good part, and cut corners on the rest of the build. It's great for them, as they're making money from ill informed consumers. 

Don't become another dissatisfied customer. It's important to educate yourself before making any purchase, especially when purchasing a gaming PC.

Take a look at the PC below: 

![Best Buy Prebuilt](/img/misc/bestbuy-pc-example.png)

As you can see, this PC is going for nearly $1100 USD. Now let's take a look at what these parts would cost you: 

![Parts vs Prebuilt](/img/misc/parts-vs-prebuilt.jpg)

This prebuilt PC is actually one of the better options out there, and still you can see that it is nearly $200 USD cheaper to build your own PC. 

Most retailers mark up their prices even more dramatically. Evidently, building your own PC is cheaper. 

Customizability is another reason why building your own PC is a good option. You can hand pick your parts, and tailor your PC exactly how you'd like it. 

You can choose your own case, LED color scheme, shape, size, noise level, cooling system, etc. PC building is practically an art form. 

If you only want to play a few games like Overwatch and CSGO for example, you don't have to buy a $1000 gaming PC. Instead, you can get the components you'd need to run those games, and nothing more. 

On the other hand, if you want to play demanding games with the best possible graphics and framerates, you can do that too. 

## Viable Prebuilt Options 

Though many prebuilt gaming PCs aren't worth the time or the money, there are some viable prebuilt options on the market. 

If you know what you're looking for, you can find some great prebuilt alternatives.

## How to Build a Dirt Cheap Gaming PC in 3 Easy Steps

![CHEAP PC INFOGRAPHIC](/img/budget-pc-tips.jpg)

If you're on an extremely low budget, there are still options for you if you're interested in building a gaming PC. 

eBay is an excellent tool if you know how to use it. If you follow this step by step guide, you can own a great gaming machine without breaking the bank.

**Keep reading to find out how to build a 1080p gaming PC for $250!** 

### Step 1: Find an old desktop for sale on eBay

The first step to building a dirt cheap gaming PC is finding an old desktop on eBay. 

[View Desktop PCs](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=desktop+pc&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: .big-button .text-center}

You're going to have to filter through lots of desktops. This may take some time. 

I'd recommend using eBay filters. Often you can find a listing that is advertised as "for parts or repair".

![Filters eBay](/img/misc/ebay-how-to/filters.jpg)

Many think that just because their PC won't power on, it's garbage. Little do they know, there are many parts inside the PC that can be salvaged. This will help you to save lots of money. 

Finding an old used desktop is also a good path to take. 

![Desktop eBay](/img/misc/ebay-how-to/desktop.png)

After 10 minutes or so of browsing eBay listings, I found this PC for sale. 

The PC is listed for $150 which is a pretty good price, but we'll get this PC for even less. 

Make sure the PC doesn't have anything wrong with it, and check out the specs of the PC. 

This Dell Optiplex 990 MT PC has: 

* Intel Core i7-2600 3.4 GHz CPU
* 8GB of DDR3 Ram
* 500GB Hard Drive
* DVD-Rom 

Furthermore, you're getting the case, power supply, and motherboard all for the low price of $150. Now it's time for the next step.

### Step 2: Negotiate a Price

The price of this PC is already low, but we want it even lower. 

Most listings allow you to make a "Best Offer". It's always a good idea to negotiate for a lower price. 

![Best Offer](/img/misc/ebay-how-to/offer.png)

Once a price is agreed upon, make the purchase. Now we move on to our third and final step. 

### Step 3: Buy a GPU 

The GPU is the most important part of any gaming PC. You really don't need the best processor to game. You don't even need a ton of ram. The GPU does all of the hard work. 

This is why we purchased an older desktop PC and salvaged the parts. The older components are still more than capable of gaming. As long as the CPU won't bottleneck, you're good to go. 

That being said, finding the right GPU is important. 

Return to eBay, and search for your GPU of choice. For this example, we'll use the [GeForce GTX 1050 ti](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MF7EQJZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MF7EQJZ&linkCode=as2&tag=flarp0c-20&linkId=b30aa04fcbfda1074ebc6672538b4918). This GPU is powerful, cheap, and great for a low end budget. 

[View GPUs](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1050+ti+&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: .big-button .text-center}

Don't be afraid to buy a used GPU. I've bought many used GPUs on eBay with no problem at all. Just read the reviews of the seller and make sure they're trusted. 

Once you find your GPU for sale on eBay, repeat the last step and await your parts to arrive! 

There you have it, a dirt cheap gaming PC!
