It only has half the cache of the Ryzen 5 and  7, but it still has all of the same features. 

In nearly every area that doesn't involve multithreaded performance, [Linus Tech Tips](https://linustechtips.com/main/), both Ryzen 3 chips outperform their Intel competitors. 

Ryzen 3 makes a lot of sense.

### The Graphics Card 
![EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 ti](/img/gpu/1050 ti.png "EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 ti"){: .img-right .img-small}


The Graphics card is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering that takes place when your PC plays a video game. 

That being said, choosing the right graphics card for your build is important. 

The EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 ti 4GB ACX 2.0 is the graphics card of choice. Currently with the extreme markup of AMD graphics cards, nVidia is the best choice in terms of price to performance.

### The Power Supply 
![EVGA 400W PSU](/img/PSU/evga 400w.png "EVGA 400W PSU"){: .img-small .img-right}


The reliability of your power supply is important. Furthermore, it is crucial to use a power supply with the proper wattage. 

Why? 

If you fail to do either of these two things, one or both of the following will happen: 

A) Your power supply will short out your PC <br>    
B) Your power supply will fail completely 

This build is rated at 211 watts. That being said, the EVGA 400W ATX power supply is the choice for this build.

## 8 Ways to Build a Budget Gaming PC 

I wanted to illustrate 8 ways to save money when building a gaming PC on a tight budget. 

These 8 tips should help you build a cheap gaming PC (see our guide on building a <a href="https://www.easypc.io/budget-pcs/">dirt cheap gaming PC</a>). 

![8 Tips for Budget PC Building](/img/infographic/8-tips-for-budget-pc-building.png)

This infographic does a great job illustrating the 8 ways you can save money when building a gaming PC. 

**[Contact me](/contact/) about using this infographic on your website!**

These 8 methods include:

* Salvaging old parts
* Buying used parts
* Buying a cheap CPU
* Focusing on the GPU
* Looking for deals
* Ask your friends 
* Save money on peripherals and LEDs
* Be patient

Let's take a closer look at each one. 

## Salvaging old parts 

It's easy to buy all of your parts new, but it's also more expensive.

Odds are you probably have an old desktop in your house that still has perfectly good components. 

You could probably salvage an optical drive, hard drive, case, power supply, and sometimes even a motherboard and CPU. 

Even if you don't have an old desktop laying around, you could buy one on eBay. This brings us to our next point. 

[Salvage Old Parts](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=desktop+pc&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: .big-button}

## Buy used parts

Some think you have to buy all new parts to build a great gaming PC. This is simply not true. 

You can look on eBay for used parts that work just as well as new ones. 

The best part?

You're getting the same great components for a lower price! 

## Buy a cheap CPU

If you're on a tight budget, the CPU is where you should save some money. 

Why?

Any well optimized title will harness the power of the GPU over the CPU. As long as your CPU can keep up, you can focus your money on the GPU. 

[View Budget Gaming CPUs](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=Pentium+G4560&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: .big-button}

## Focus on the GPU 

As mentioned above, the GPU is the most important part of a gaming PC.

If you're on a budget, you should cut corners elsewhere and focus that money towards buying a powerful GPU. 

We recommend the GTX 1050 ti as the best budget gaming GPU. 

[View GTX 1050 ti on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2xb0SXA){: .big-button}

## Look for Deals

There are tech deals every day online. It's easy to find them too. 

Nearly all large tech corporations have a newsletter or email alert service.

Simply sign up, and let the emails flow in. More often then not they are notifying you about a great deal. 

You can also negotiate on Craig's List, use a deal finder, coupon codes, etc. 

## Ask Friends

Ask your friends about old PCs they might have laying around. Odds are they have an old computer in their house which is full of great parts. 

If you're lucky, they might have some spare parts they'd be willing to give you either for free or for a reduced price. It's a great way to save money!

## Save Money on Peripherals and LEDs 

Most people want a case full of cool LEDs, a mechanical keyboard with different colors and the best gaming mouse. 

While these things are great additions to a PC gamer's setup, they're NOT necessary. Any mouse and keyboard will do and you don't need LEDs in your case. 

It's much wiser to invest this money in your gaming PC. Later on down the line if you have the money, feel free to invest it in these extra items.

## Be patient 

If you don't have enough money to buy the best parts, that's okay. Just be patient and save your money.

It's better to wait and buy better parts than to impulse buy low end parts that won't do you any good.
