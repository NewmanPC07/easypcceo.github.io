### The Case 

NZXT is well known for their superb case designs. The NZXT - S340 in White is no exception. Sleek, refined, spacious, and sturdy, the NZXT is the perfect case for any mid range PC build.

* Spacious
* Compatible for you

How will this case benefit you? 

This case is forged from steel; furthermore, it features a grommet-less cable management bar that keeps the cables tidy. It is two inches smaller than other mid-towers, and easy for new builders to use. 

With a large side panel window, you'll be able to see your parts in action. 

Specs:

* Color - White
* Internal 3.5" Bays - 3

### The Processor 

For a $500 build, you couldn't choose a better processor than the i3-7100. 

Perfect for a budget gaming computer, the i3-7100 packs one heck of a punch inside its new Kaby Lake architecture.

Harnessing of the power of the new Kaby Lake architecture, a 3.9 GHz clock speed, and hyperthreading, this processor has it all. 

Here's the thing: 

No longer do you need an i5 to game in 1080p with ultra settings. We live in an age in which the price of processors and graphics cards is on the decline, and ram is becoming more expensive. 

Funny, right?  

 The i3-7100 can be paired with just about any low to mid range graphics card, and it will play ball. 

 But here's the kicker: 

 
Specs:

 * Cores - 2
 * Threads - 4 
 * Hyperthreading - Yes 
 * Base Frequency - 3.9 GHz
 * TDP - 51 W
 * Cache - 3 MB
 * Lithography - 14 nm

 Hyperthreading technology is what makes this processor so powerful. Though it only has 2 physical cores, each core is able to process 2 threads, instead of just one.

Why is this important? 

 This means it effectively has 4 cores, not 2.
