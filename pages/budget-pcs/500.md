## $500 Build Guide

### The Case 

NZXT is well known for their superb case designs. The NZXT - S340 in White is no exception. Sleek, refined, spacious, and sturdy; the NZXT is the perfect case for any mid range PC build. 

A good case must be: 

* Eye catching 
* Aerodynamic (if you will)
* The right size 
* Spacious
* Compatible for you

How will this case benefit you? 

This case is forged from steel; furthermore, it features a grommet-less cable management bar that keeps the cables tidy. It is two inches smaller than other mid-towers, and easy for new builders to use. 

With a large side panel window, you'll be able to see your parts in action. 

Specs: 

* Type - ATX Mid Tower
* Color - White
* Internal 3.5" Bays - 3
* Internal 2.5" Bays - 2

### The Processor 

For a $500 build, you couldn't choose a better processor than the i3-7100. 

Perfect for a budget gaming computer, the i3-7100 packs one heck of a punch inside its new Kaby Lake architecture.

Harnessing of the power of the new architecture, a 3.9 GHz clock speed, and hyperthreading, this processor has it all. 

Here's the thing: 

No longer do you need an i5 to game in 1080p with ultra settings. We live in an age in which the price of processors and graphics cards is on the decline, and ram is becoming more expensive. 

Funny, right?  

 The i3-7100 can be paired with just about any low to mid range graphics card, and it will play ball. 


Specs:

 * Cores - 2
 * Threads - 4 
 * Hyperthreading - Yes 
 * Base Frequency - 3.9 GHz
 * TDP - 51 W
 * Cache - 3 MB
 * Lithography - 14 nm

 Hyperthreading technology is what makes this processor so powerful. Though it only has 2 physical cores, each core is able to process 2 threads, instead of just one.

Why is this important? 

 It effectively has 4 cores, not 2.

For the price of just $62, you are getting a great deal. Not only is it sturdy and reliable, it supports 2400 MHz ram. 

What's the bottom line here? 

Not only are you getting a superb motherboard, you're getting it for less than $70.

### The Ram 

Believe it or not, the speed of your ram can actually impact the performance of your processor. 

That's why this build features a Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 8GB kit (2x4GB) of DDR4 2400 MHz ram. Dual channel 2400 MHz ram will help with the performance of the processor. 

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, it really has a minimal effect on frame rate. 8GB is perfect for this bugdget. 

Specs:

* Type - 288 pin DIMM
* Speed - DDR4-2400 MHz 
* Size - 8GB (2x4GB)

### The Graphics Card 

The Graphics card is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering that takes place when your PC plays a video game. 

That being said, choosing the right graphics card for your build is important. 

The EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 ti 4GB ACX 2.0 is the graphics card of choice. Currently with the extreme markup of AMD graphics cards, nVidia is the best choice in terms of price to performance. 

On this budget, the 1050 ti is all around the best choice for a few reasons: 

Not only is this card rocking 4GB of DDR5 dedicated memory, it has a core clock of 1.29 GHz. 

What's so good about this?

* Higher resolution in game
* Higher frames per second 
* Higher graphical settings 
* Multiple monitor capability 

Specs: 

* Chipset - GeForce GTX 1050 ti 
* Memory Size - 4GB
* Memory Type - GDDR5
* Base Frequency - 1.29 GHz
* Boost Frequency - 1.39 GHz
* TDP - 75 Watts 
* Length - 5.71"

### The Power Supply 

The reliability of your power supply is important. Furthermore, it is crucial to use a power supply with the proper wattage. 

Why? 

If you fail to do either of these two things, one or both of the following will happen: 

A) Your power supply will short out your PC <br>    
B) Your power supply will fail completely 

This build is rated at 211 watts. That being said, the EVGA 400W ATX power supply is the choice for this build. 

It has more than enough power, and combined with its $30 price tag, it is an absolute steal. 

Specs: 

* Type - ATX
* Wattage - 400 Watts
* Fans - 1
* Modular - No 
* Efficiency - 80+ 
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors - 1
