We get it... 

You want to build a gaming PC that can play all games at 60 FPS, but you're on a tight budget. 

That's why we've created this budget gaming PC – for just $500, this gaming PC can run any title in 1080p with stunning graphics. 

## Build Overview 

This gaming PC will destroy games like PUBG in 1080p resolution with an average of at least 60 FPS with medium to high settings. 

Fortnite is better optimized than PUBG, and will run even better as a consequence. You can expect to crush 100+ FPS with high settings in 1080p. 

Other popular titles – including CS:GO, GTA V, Call of Duty, and Battlefield – will also run well on this build. 

You won't be able to max out every title with ultra settings in 1080p, but all games will be playable if you're willing to tweak the settings accordingly. 

All in all, it's an awesome budget gaming PC, perfect for anyone who wants to get into PC gaming without breaking the bank.

<h2>Ryzen 3 2200G</h2>
<h3>Quad-Core Processor</h3>
<p>The Ryzen 3 2200G is the newest addition to the Ryzen 3 line. Featuring four physical cores and a base clock speed of 3.5 GHz, this AMD CPU punches above its weight class. It's a fantastic processor for a budget gaming PC, thanks to its strong performance and low price tag.</p>

AMD's newest CPU in the Ryzen 3 family – the Ryzen 3 2200G – is awesome for gamers on a budget, as it offers great performance in general usage and most games at 1080p. Unfortunately, this CPU will start to struggle when you try streaming or rendering, as these tasks are CPU intensive. 

Moreover, certain games that are poorly optimized and draw a lot of power from the CPU may not perform as well as they would with a more expensive and more powerful CPU. 

However, most games are well-optimized and draw mostly from the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). This means you don't need a powerhouse CPU for gaming, especially when you're on a tight budget.

Instead, it would be best to focus your resources on a powerful GPU, as it is responsible for 3D rendering and handles most gaming related tasks. 

Besides, for just $100, the Ryzen 3 2200G really holds its own, especially when compared to its Intel counterpart in the same price range. 

When it comes to pairing this CPU with the right GPU, it caps out right around the RX 580. Keep this in mind if/when you decide to upgrade your build. 

Unfortunately it's just not possible to include a CPU worthy of streaming on a budget like this, but in terms of gaming, this CPU will surely get the job done.

<h2>ASUS ROG Strix Radeon RX 570</h2>
<h3>4GB Graphics Card</h3>
<p>The RX 570 is one of the best GPUs in the ~$200 price range at the moment. It won't have any problems running games in 1080p with 60 FPS in most modern AAA titles, and will max out older titles with ease. However, the RX 570 is not powerful enough for VR or 1440p gaming, so keep that in mind.</p>

The ASUS ROG Strix Radeon RX 570 has a dual-exhaust system to help maintain stable temperatures under heavy load. It has a base clock of 1.168 GHz and a boost clock of 1.31 GHz under heavy load. Moreover, this GPU is also sporting 4GB of dedicated DDR5 VRAM, which is perfect for 1080p gaming at high settings. 

It has two DVI-D Dual-Link ports, one Displayport and one HDMI port. 

This GPU's performance is superior to that of the Xbox One and PS4. It consumes a maximum of 150 watts, which is on-par with other GPUs in the same price-range and weight class. 

Lastly, this model is 240mm in length – a bit longer than other GPUs on the market, but it will fit nicely in our case thanks to its spacious interior.

<h2>Corsair Vengeance LPX 1x8GB</h2>
<h3>DDR4-2400MHz Memory</h3>
<p>Luckily RAM prices have cooled off, so you can pick up this 8GB stick of RAM for less than $60. Its higher clock speed will help the Ryzen CPU's performance significantly, as Ryzen CPUs tend to be more sensitive to RAM speed than their Intel counterparts.</p>

Rather than buying two 4GB sticks and running them in a dual-channel configuration, we chose a single 8GB stick instead. 

The motherboard only has two DIMM slots, which means if you want to upgrade in the future you can easily add another 8GB stick, rather than having to replace two 4GB sticks with two 8GB sticks. 

There's not much to say when it comes to RAM – this particular RAM stick is from Corsair, so you can rest assured knowing it'll work reliably for a long time.

<h2>Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB</h2>
<h3>7200 RPM Hard Drive </h3>
<p>Western Digital is a well-respected and trusted company among the PC gaming community. Their Caviar Blue 1TB hard drive has become the go-to storage solution for many gaming PC builds, ranging from beginner budget builds to expensive enthusiast builds.</p>

The WD Caviar Blue 1TB drive has plenty of space for all of your games, apps, movies, pictures, songs, etc. 

It has a 64 MB cache and a rotational speed of 7200 RPM, which is definitely preferred to the slower 5400 RPM model. 

It is recommended, however, that you add an SSD in the future, as they're much faster. 

We couldn't include one in the build due to budget restrictions, but a 240GB SSD would be a great choice later on down the road. 

You can load Windows, drivers, and your favorite games onto the SSD. As a consequence, your PC will boot far more quickly and it will be more responsive overall. 

In the meantime, the WD Caviar Blue 1TB drive will surely get the job done. It's always nice to have a reliable mass storage drive.

<h2>Fractal Design Focus G</h2>
<h3>Black ATX Mid-Tower Case</h3>
<p>The Fractal Design Focus G may not look like a cheap case, but it is surprisingly affordable. It has superb airflow, a clean design, a nice side-panel window, plenty of drive space, and a spacious interior. What more could you ask for? </p>

</div>

In order to maximize the case's full airflow potential, it would be wise to add one or two extra [case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/). This case supports both [120mm](/budget-pcs/case-fans/120mm/) and [140mm](/budget-pcs/case-fans/140mm/) case fans, so you can choose which you'd prefer. 

In terms of specifications, the case has two 5.25" bays, one 2.5" bay, and two 3.5" bays. Considering this is a budget build, you'll have enough space for your primary mass storage drive, in addition to an SSD if you want to add one later on down the line. 

Anyway, the case is an ATX mid-tower, with dimensions of 464mm x 205mm x 444mm. The case's spacious interior supports ATX, Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX boards, and graphics cards with a maximum length of 380mm. It comes equipped with front panel USB 3.0 ports, and it ships with two intake fans mounted on the front of the case, but we'd highly recommend you add another exhaust fan for optimal airflow.

<h2>ASRock B450M-HDV</h2>
<h3>Micro-ATX Motherboard</h3>
<p>ASRock's B450M-HDV is a small motherboard, but don't underestimate its potential. Featuring AMD's newest B450 chipset, this motherboard is great for overclockers on a budget, and it even supports micro-tiering StoreMI technology which lets you speed up a hard drive with an SSD.</p>

On a budget, we couldn't afford extra features such as SLI or Crossfire support. This isn't the end of the world, as you couldn't even afford two GPUs on this budget either. 

However, this will affect future upgradeability. Rather than being able to configure two GPUs in one system, you'll simply have to upgrade the GPU altogether. 

Nevertheless, this motherboard has a B450 chipset, which is basically the second generation of AMD's B350 chipset which was launched with the first-generation Ryzen CPUs. 

It's a small iteration of the previous generation, with a few new features as mentioned above: micro-tiering StoreMI technology and overclocking support. 

The latter is what we're more concerned about here – the Ryzen 3 2200G is unlocked out of the box, and its overclocking performance is exemplary. If you're buying an AMD CPU, you ought to overclock it! 

The motherboard only has two DIMM slots, which is why we chose a single 8GB stick of RAM as opposed to two 4GB sticks. 

Despite dual-channel memory running slightly faster, you wouldn't be able to upgrade to 16GB of RAM without selling your already purchased twin 4GB sticks and buying a pack of two 8GB sticks. 

This way, you can simply purchase another 8GB stick in the future and pop it right in, hassle free. 

The motherboard also has 4 SATA 6GB/s ports, onboard [ethernet](/gaming-ethernet-cable/) and onboard USB 3.0 headers. 

All in all, it gets the job done, it's cheap, and it's overclocker friendly. On a low budget, that's a win in our book!

It's a semi-modular power supply, meaning you only have to use the cables that you need, rather than having a bunch of extra cables protruding from the PSU. 

You won't have to jumble up a bunch of unused cables and stuff them in your case – not only is bad cable management ugly, but it is also bad for airflow. With this power supply, cable management will be easy. 

This PSU is also 80+ Bronze Certified, meaning it is power efficient and reliable. You won't have to worry about it shorting out your components or wasting a lot of electricity like other, cheaper power supplies. 

Thanks to the build's efficient components, it doesn't draw a lot of power, so we don't need a beefy PSU to power the PC. This PSU is cheap, reliable, semi-modular, and efficent. 

## Suggested Upgrades 

This PC is awesome for just $500, but later on down the road you'll probably want to make a few additions when you have the extra money to spare. Here's a list of our recommendations: 

* **Case Fans:** Although the case does ship with two [case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/) pre-installed, they're both mounted to the case's front panel and they're intake fans. Unfortunately, the case doesn't include an exhaust fan. We'd highly recommend adding an exhaust fan ASAP, as it's important to have both air intake and exhaust to maintain a steady stream of cool air. 

* **Solid State Drive:** It would be wise to add an SSD (Solid State Drive) as soon as you can. You can transfer your Windows OS, drivers, and games onto your SSD. As a result, your PC will boot significantly faster, and it will be ready immediately. If you've ever felt like your computer is slow when you first power it on and you have to wait for it to 'warm up,' it's probably because you have your OS installed on a mechanical drive. If you have your OS and games on an SSD, your PC will boot quickly, it'll be responsive immediately, and you'll be the first to load into games. 

## Is a $500 Gaming PC Worth It?

If you're interested in playing popular titles in 1080p with medium to high settings (some even ultra) while maintaining 60 FPS, then yes, it's definitely worth it. 

Building a gaming PC on a 500 dollar budget is fantastic for beginner builders who are just getting into PC gaming.

Now, you won't be able to max out every game in 1080p or 1400p, nor will you be able to play VR games. 

However, you will have an awesome time playing most AAA titles with stunning graphics, far superior to console graphics. Moreover, building a gaming PC is a great learning experience. 

Customizability is one of the best parts about PC gaming, not to mention upgradeability. You can always add better components in the future to your PC without having to scrap the whole thing.
