Here's the deal:

If you're looking for the best and the smallest ATX case money can buy, you've come to the right place. 

I've procured the ultimate "smallest ATX case" list so you can make the best decision when purchasing your next case! 

By the way, ATX is the largest form factor, so even the smallest ATX cases are going to be somewhat large, if that makes sense. 

If you really want small, then you should check out the post I wrote about the [smallest micro ATX cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-micro-atx-cases/) on the market. They're just as cool as the cases below, but even smaller!

Anyway, *let's get started:* 

## Smallest ATX Case Options

When it comes to building a gaming PC, choosing the right case is incredibly important. 

Not only are they tasked with protecting your precious components, they must also provide adequate airflow, not to mention they have to look cool! 

Anyway, finding the smallest full size ATX case in 2019 can be challenging. In an effort to make your life easier, **here are the best small ATX cases:**

The [Corsair Carbide Series 400C](https://amzn.to/2PorXR8){: target="_blank"} features an elegant case design and is the smaller, non-inverted version of the Carbide 600C ATX case.

Corsair decided to remove the 5.25" drive bays – the empty space that would otherwise be occupied by somewhat obsolete 5.25-inch bays can be used to mount radiators and case fans, which is especially nice in a small [ATX](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/38148/atx-motherboard){: target="_blank"} case.

The Air 540 has a wide outer shell with two side-by-side chambers inside to provide the best airflow possible. 

This case seems compact on the outside, yet it is surprisingly spacious inside with superb airflow. 

Lastly, the case makes it easy to manage cables, making for a truly professional and presentable gaming PC optimized for the best cooling performance.

The [Core G3 Slim ATX Case](https://amzn.to/2vTJbgT){: target="_blank"} is the second case from Thermaltake's Core series. 

This case offers a stylish full sized form factor without being too big and bulky. 

In recent years, Thermaltake has produced many cases that are largely popular, especially their Core series. 

The Thermaltake Core G3 is no exception, offering a stylish full sized form factor without being too big and bulky. 

It's also one of the cheaper cases on this list, so you could use it if you're building a cheap gaming PC. 

## Case Buying Guide

![Carbide Air 540](/img/case/carbide-air-540.png){: .img-right .img-small}

If you're interested in building a gaming PC, it is imperative that you choose the [right case](https://www.computercaselab.com/what-makes-a-computer-case-the-best-for-gaming/){: target="_blank"}. Of course, that's easier said than done. 

In an effort to aid those new to building gaming computers, I've created this guide to help you understand everything you need to know when it comes to selecting the best ATX case. 

**So, what's the deal with ATX, micro-ATX, and mini-ITX?** 

The names stem from motherboard size categories. Motherboards are grouped into these three categories.

ATX is the largest, micro-ATX is a bit smaller, and mini-ITX is the smallest. 

At the moment, full-sized ATX cases are the most popular form factor for a variety of reasons. 

ATX motherboards are 12 × 9.6 inches (305 × 244 mm). ATX cases are usually also compatible with micro-ATX motherboards, which are 9.6 × 9.6 inches (244 × 244 mm). 

Lastly, mini-ITX motherboards are 6.7 × 6.7 inches (170 x 170 mm), making them the smallest of the three form-factors. 

Since cases are responsible for housing motherboards, cases are categorized in the same manner (ATX, micro-ATX, etc.) 

It's always important to ensure that the case you want is compatible with your motherboard's form factor. 

## A Great Case Is... 

**1.** A great gaming case is strong. Avoid cases constructed with flimsy plastic – after all, your case is supposed to protect your parts and keep them from breaking, right? 

A few plastic parts here and there are okay and most cases have some plastic. However, ensure the plastic is strong and of high quality before risking your expensive components. 

**2.** A great gaming case has fantastic [airflow](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/215986-how-important-is-airflow/){: target="_blank"}. If your case doesn't have good airflow, your PC could overheat and shut down. 

Despite being able to handle high temperatures, your parts can become damaged if they are too hot. Whether you're using 80mm, 120mm, or 140mm case fans, *airflow is incredibly important!*

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh6F2eccMec" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

**3.** A great gaming case has room for plenty of *quiet* case fans! This goes hand-in-hand with airflow. If your case doesn't have space to add case fans, it's a no go. 

![Thermaltake Core G3](/img/case/thermaltake-core-g3.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

Most gaming cases ship with fans included – many of them have cool looking LEDs too. 

But before you're fooled by fancy lights, it's important to make sure your fans are quiet. 

Noisy fans can be especially annoying if you're sensitive to noise. 

**4.** A great gaming case has enough room for your components! This may seem obvious, but some cases don't have enough room for CPU coolers and graphics cards. 

For example, the first time I built a gaming PC, the hard drive bays in my case got in the way of my graphics card!

**5.** A great gaming case has good cable management options. This means there is plenty of space for your cables, and they can be run throughout the case in a neat and orderly fashion. 

Instead of bundling them up inside the case – which is both ugly and bad for airflow – you can run your cables in the back. 

This keeps your case looking clean and promotes good airflow.

Before you pull the trigger on the case of your dreams, make sure that: 

* Your graphics card will fit inside the case
* Your CPU cooler will fit inside the case
* Your case has enough hard drive bays

Otherwise, you'll be quite disappointed!

## Do You Need a 'Gaming' Case?

Many companies advertise their cases as "gaming cases". Just because a case is outfitted with cool LED lights does not necessarily make it a gaming case. 

Most uneducated customers will buy a case simply for its looks, without really considering the factors mentioned above. 

It is more important to find a functional case that provides good airflow and cable management. A good case must also be sturdy and cost effective. 

Sure, a good looking case is always nice, but it is *not* necessary. If you're on a budget, especially a budget below $500, don't spend more than $50 on your case. 

In fact, I'd recommend spending $40 or less. 

## Case Reviews

This is the part of the article where I go a bit more in-depth. I'll be taking a closer look at each case, talking about the pros and cons of each one, any notable features, the design, and why I decided to include the case in this list.

In today's day and age, people are consuming their media much differently than they used to even a few years ago. 

Optical drives are becoming less common, as most of the data you'd need can be downloaded directly to your computer's hard drive, which have also grown in storage capacity. 

Moreover, rather than popping your favorite movie into the DVD player, most people choose to watch movies and TV shows via their favorite online streaming service, such as Netflix or Hulu. 

Corsair has taken note of this shift, and decided to remove 5.25-inch optical drive bays entirely from this case. 

Although some people may be disappointed by this decision, in my opinion, it's actually a good choice. 

The case doesn't have optical drive bays, which frees up space for other things, including case fans, multiple GPUs, radiators, and extra space between hard drives which results in cooler temperatures. 

Moreover, the interior of the case is more spacious, which promotes better airflow. Lastly, the case can accomodate motherboards as large as E-ATX, which is pretty awesome. 

<figure>
<img class="img-middle" alt="back of corsair carbide 400c" src="/img/case/corsair-carbide-400c-back.jpg" />

</figure>

The 400C has a clean, modern, and minimalistic design with an entirely steel exterior. 

The overall design of the case feels sleek and refined. It has a nice black finish with a large side-panel window, allowing you to peek inside and take a look at your components. 

Although it's not flashy, when you step into the room, the case has a presence. 

Its minimalistic design is almost graceful in a way – its visual points of interest are subtler compared to other flashy cases with bright lights that are dying for attention. 

This case, on the other hand, knows its good-looking, and doesn't have to show off to get the attention it deserves. 

On a more serious note, I'd like to talk about the actual design features of the case. 

The 400C measures 464 x 215 x 425mm (HxWxD) and weighs in at around 18 lbs. It's a smaller version of it's big brother, the 600C, but the case doesn't feel cramped. 

The outside of the 400C is mostly steel, but the door handle, feet, and ventilation dividers are made of plastic. Overall, the case is of a solid construction.

It comes with a pre-installed 140mm fan in the front. If you wish, you can remove the 140mm fan and install three 120mm case fans instead. 

You can even add another two 120mm or 140mm fans in the top of the case, or mount a water cooling radiator up to 360mm in size. 

The case supports up to five storage devices, two of which are 3.5-inch drives and two 2.5-inch drive bays for SSDs. 

The power supply and the removable 3.5-inch drive cage are both protected by overlapping plastic shrouds. When the plastic shrouds are there (they're removable), they hide most of the case's wiring, giving it a cleaner look and feel. 

The case also has several cable cutouts, which are lined with rubber. 

There are three next to the motherboard tray. If you're installing a Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX board, you may find it difficult to use the cutouts all together. It really depends on the length of your cables. 

![Corsair 400C inside](/img/case/400c-inside.png){: .img-middle}

The 400C isn't a flashy case, but it's still a classy case with a low-profile. 

Despite its slightly smaller size, the case can hold a lot, thanks to Corsair's decision to get rid of 5.25-inch drive bays. 

The case doesn't have any fancy LED lighting, a common trait among gaming cases. However, it does ship with a nice side-panel window, and you can always add case fans with LEDs if you wish. 

I'd like this case a bit more if its cable cutouts were placed differently, as it's somewhat difficult to use them unless you have an ATX or E-ATX motherboard. 

Nevertheless, it's not the end of the world, and they get the job done. 

What's the moral of the story here? 

If you're hunting for the best smallest ATX case, the Corsair Carbide 400C should be a strong contender on your list of possible candidates.

The Corsair Carbide Series Air 540 has taken second place on our list. 

It's an ATX Cube chassis, meaning the motherboard, CPU and GPU were compartmentalized from the rest of the build.

In order to achieve this feat, Corsair had to widen the chassis. One chamber is for your motherboard and 3.5" drive bays, while the other chamber houses the power supply, solid state drives, and 5.25" bays. 

Both chambers streamline airflow to provide the best possible cooling solution. On top of the compartmentalized interior, Corsair has also left room for water cooling compatibility and HDD bays with back planes. 

Despite being a small ATX case, the Carbide Air 540 is very well designed. 

Its two compartments keep cables and components neat and tidy, which promotes airflow, thus keeping the entire rig looking good and staying cool. 

The case is mostly constructed of steel on the inside, but Corsair decided to use ABS plastic and steel mesh to give the cube ATX case a unique and good-looking style. 

The case measures 415 x 332 x 458mm (HxWxD). Surprisingly, this case can house motherboards as small as Mini-ITX all the way up to full-sized E-ATX boards, and has eight expansion slots in the back. 

![Corsair Air 540 Side](/img/case/air-540-side.jpg){: .img-middle}

It can house two 3.5-inch drives on the floor, and has a drive rack in the back which supports up to four 2.5-inch drives as well. 

It even supports two 5.25-inch drives. 

This is the smallest ATX case on our list, yet its interior seems more spacious than most mid-tower ATX cases on the market, thanks to Corsair's ingenious design. 

Beneath the ODD bays, you'll find two USB ports in addition to the HD Audio jacks. 

The case ships with three AF140L 140mm fans, one near the rear of the motherboard compartment which serves as the exhaust, and the other two are up front, mounted behind a dust filter. 

They serve as the case's intake fans. Together, the fans intake cool air and exhaust the case's warm air out the back of the case. 

The left side of the case has thick plastic lines seperated by mesh, with a Corsair logo in the center. 

The right side of the case has flat textured plastic, where you'll find a pair of 5.25-inch bays and the front I/O panel. The left side of the case is mostly a tempered glass window, allowing you to see inside the case. 

The glass is lined with steel, ensuring the panel is sturdy. 

![Air 540 Interior](/img/case/air-540-interior.png){: .img-middle}

Behind the glass panel, you'll find the motherboard tray which can house anything up to Extended ATX motherboards, with nine cable management cutouts, eight of which have grommets in them. 

It also offers five tie points. You'll even find an incredibly large access hole for sockets on the EATX boards. 

The rear of the case is well ventilated, allowing air to escape thanks to the 140mm rear exhaust fan. 

There are several other companies offering case's with a similar design, but many of the other options out there are overpriced. 

The Air 540 is the first case of this style on the market from a reputable company with a reasonable price tag. 

The case is aesthetically pleasing, delivers solid acoustic and thermal performance, and its design is truly revolutionary. 

If you're looking for an affordable and small ATX case, definitely check out Corsair's Air 540.

The case is a big larger than its mATX little brother, the H400i. This is the smallest full ATX case in the series. If you want something a bit smaller, you can opt for the NZXT H400i, but keep in mind that the H400i does not support full ATX motherboards. 

The top of the case has two USB 3.1 ports, an HDD activity LED, a power button, and headphone and microphone jacks. 

Besides the 120/140mm fan mounting grille, the top of the case is smooth and barren. The front of the case is also featureless, but the side panel has a tinted tempered glass window, covering about 3/4 of the side of the case. 

The other side panel has vented holes for airflow, and both panels are mounted via thumbscrews. 

Looking to the rear of the case, there's not much to report. You'll find seven expansion slots (and two for vertical GPU mounting, which is a lovely feature), the I/O panel area, a 120mm exhaust fan mounting location, and a PSU opening on the bottom. 

The PSU area has a dust filter included, and the case's four rubber feet keep the case elevated to promote proper airflow. 

The case's interior doesn't have much pre-installed – no hard drive racks, no intake fans, and no optical drive bays. NZXT leaves everything up to you when it comes to building. 

The only thing that you'll find inside the case from the factory is a cable management bar. There's plenty of room for a plethora of different system builds. 

There are mounting locations for two 2.5" drives and two 3.5" drives. You can either mount the drives on top of the PSU tunnel or behind the motherboard tray. 

The two mounting locations by the PSU compartment do not have any caddies. Rather, the drives slide into the removable steel rack and are held in place by screws. 

If you wish to remove or install new drives after your PC has been assembled, you'll have to remove the hard drive rack or the PSU. 

The H500i comes with two 120mm fans pre-installed, but their placement is a bit weird. 

One of them is mounted in the rear as an exhaust fan, which is standard. However, the other fan is mounted to the top of the case. 

Moreover, the exhaust fan has a filter, which does not make a whole lot of sense either. Luckily you can move the case to the front of the fan as an intake. The case supports radiators up to 280mm, which can be mounted to the front of the main compartment.

NZXT advertises this case as a "smart case", hense the 'i' in the name. 

This case is loaded with awesome features, including an Adaptive Noise Reduction algorithm that adjusts fan speeds based on temperature and measured noise changes. 

The case also comes with a fan controller and an LED RGB lighting controller. Lastly, the H500i ships with two pre-installed RGB lighting strips, one of which is located behind the cable management bar and the other in the top of the chassis. 

The case's sleek design coupled with elegant lighting makes for an eye-catching case that isn't overwhelming.

Cooler Master's XB is the newest member of the HAF line of cases. The HAF XB is – unlike any other case on the market – a hybrid between an ATX case and a bench table, with two seperate levels for different components.

The case allows you to put your storage devices and PSU on one level at the bottom of the case. The rest of your components, such as your motherboard, GPU, CPU, etc. are housed on the top level of this two-story enclosure. 

What's the appeal here? 

The components on the second story enjoy unobstructed airflow, and at the same time, the heat from the PSU and hard drives are kept in their own enclosure. Moreover, the HAF XB's top and side panels can all be removed, which means the case could also be used as a test bench.

The case is compatible with all modern tower-style coolers, and can support a 240mm radiator in addition to another 120mm radiator installed at the same time. 

The HAF XB also offers hot-swapping for two hard drives, and has carrying handles on the sides which make transportation easy. 

If you're looking for a case with exceptional build quality, you can't go wrong with this chassis. The case is stable, sturdy, and everything sits securely in place without rattling. 

Even the PCI slot covers are solid, as opposed to the flimsy sheets you'll find with many other cases. 

This case ships with two of Cooler Master's very own A12025-18CB-3EN-F1 fans, which spin at a rate of 1800 RPM. Unfortunately, they don't have integrated fan control, which means they generate a bit more noise than I'd like. 

On the other hand, this case was designed with "High Air Flow" in mind, so it's clear that cooling performance was Cooler Master's number one priority. Besides, you can always add your own fan controller if you wish.

The case has dust filters on just about every air intake in order to combat dust from entering the enclosure and clogging up fans, damaging components, etc. 

In summary, the HAF XB has a unqiue design. It can be used as a small ATX case, or as a test bench, or both! The handles on the chassis' side panels make for a great LAN box, too. 

Its seperate compartments help regulate internal temperatures, as the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and RAM get to enjoy unobstructed and continuous airflow. 

The case also has great cable management options, as you can run wiring through the lower level of the case to the upper level where the second compartment houses most of your components. 

The case's form factor isn't for everyone, but for those looking for a small ATX case, the HAF XB is great. Oh, and you can use it as a test bench, too. 

## Conclusion 

Don't be fooled by advertisements and flashy lights. A great case is sturdy, provides good airflow, has a spacious interior, etc. 

Of course, the more you pay, the higher quality case you'll have. Nowadays, there are so many case options to choose from it becomes overwhelming.

It is a way to show off your personality – at the same time though, it's important to buy a case that's functional. If you are building a new gaming PC on a tight budget and you have an old computer laying around that you don't use anymore, don't be afraid to tear out the old parts to reuse the case! 

At the end of the day, the your PC build comes down to your budget, your personal preferences, and what you're looking to do with your PC. That's the beauty of PC gaming – you can tailor your PC to suit your needs!
