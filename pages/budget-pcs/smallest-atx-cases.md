## Case Buying Guide

If you're interested in building a gaming PC, it is imperative that you choose the right case. Of course, that's easier said than done. 

In an effort to aid those new to building gaming computers, I've created this guide to help you understand everything you need to know when it comes to selecting the best ATX case. 

**So, what's the deal with ATX, micro-ATX, and mini-ITX?** 

The names stem from motherboard size categories. Motherboards are grouped into these three categories.

ATX is the largest, micro-ATX is a bit smaller, and mini-ITX is the smallest. 

At the moment, full-sized ATX cases are the most popular form factor for a variety of reasons. ATX motherboards are 12 × 9.6 inches (305 × 244 mm). ATX cases are usually also compatible with micro-ATX motherboards, which are 9.6 × 9.6 inches (244 × 244 mm). 

Lastly, mini-ITX motherboards are 6.7 × 6.7 inches (170 x 170 mm), making them the smallest of the three form-factors. 

Since cases are responsible for housing motherboards, cases are categorized in the same manner (ATX, micro-ATX, etc.) It's always important to ensure that the case you want is compatible with your motherboard's form factor. 

## A Great Case Is... 

**1.** A great gaming case is strong. Avoid cases constructed with flimsy plastic – after all, your case is supposed to protect your parts and keep them from breaking, right? 

A few plastic parts here and there are okay and most cases have some plastic. However, ensure the plastic is strong and of high quality before risking your expensive components. 

**2.** A great gaming case has fantastic airflow. If your case doesn't have good airflow, your PC could overheat and shut down. Despite being able to handle high temperatures, your parts can become damaged if they are too hot. *Airflow is incredibly important!*

**3.** A great gaming case has room for plenty of *quiet* case fans! This goes hand-in-hand with airflow. If your case doesn't have space to add case fans, it's a no go.

Most gaming cases ship with fans included – many of them have cool looking LEDs too. But before you're fooled by fancy lights, it's important to make sure your fans are quiet. Noisy fans can be especially annoying if you're sensitive to noise. 

**4.** A great gaming case has enough room for your components! This may seem obvious, but some cases don't have enough room for CPU coolers and graphics cards. For example, the first time I built a gaming PC, the hard drive bays in my case got in the way of my graphics card!

Before you pull the trigger on the case of your dreams, make sure that: 

* Your graphics card will fit inside the case
* Your CPU cooler will fit inside the case
* Your case has enough hard drive bays
