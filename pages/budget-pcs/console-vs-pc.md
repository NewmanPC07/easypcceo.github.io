Yep, that's right...

We've compiled the ultimate list of reasons why PC gaming is superior to console gaming. 

So, the next time a console peasant tries to say otherwise, just show them this article. They'll soon realize they were sorely mistaken. 

Without further adue, let's jump right in! 

## 1. PC Gamers Have Bigger Junk 

Okay, maybe we don't... but we sure act like it. 

## 2. Higher Resolutions 

Gaming PCs are capable of playing video games in 1080p, 1440p, and even 2160p (4K). 

Consoles can barely play games in 1080p, and you can't adjust their resolution. 

Even if you're gaming on a 4K television, you'll still be gaming in a lower resolution. 

## 3. Higher Framerates 

Rather than being limited to a mere 30 FPS in some titles, gaming PCs can run AAA titles at 60+ FPS. 

Yes, the human eye can see the difference. It's especially obvious when you're playing. 30 FPS just feels clunky... 

Moreover, you can game at 60 FPS with higher resolutions that just 1080p. Some gaming PCs can handle 1440p and even 4K at 60 FPS. It's pretty remarkable and definitely visually pleasing. 

## 4. PC Gamers get More Girls 

This one is a fact – like it or not, girls can't get enough of PC gamers. 

There's nothing sexier than a man who knows his way around a mouse and keyboard, not to mention an ATX motherboard. 

## 5. Keyboard and Mouse 

It is far easier to use a keyboard and mouse, as opposed to a console controller. 

Although you may struggle with the mouse and keyboard at first, you'll never want to go back to a console controller once you get the hang of it. 

Think about it: 

A mouse can track movements WAY more precisely than a controller ever could. Moreover, your wrist can control a mouse more precisely than your thumb can control a joystick. 

That's why consoles have aim-assist by default, and PCs do not – PC gamers don't need aim-assist. Seriously, turn it off one day and try to play. It's near impossible to be accurate for most players, and it's hard for even the most skilled console gamers. 

You can even customize your gaming mouse's macro buttons with additional controls. You can have a ton of controls right at your fingertips. 

If the best PC Fortnite player went head to head against the best console player, the PC player would win every time.
