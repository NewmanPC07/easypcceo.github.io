## [Dell Inspiron i5675 Gaming Desktop](http://amzn.to/2ECKwM9){:target="_blank"} - $500

The little brother of our $600 prebuilt gaming PC, the [Dell Inspiron i5675 Gaming Desktop](http://amzn.to/2ECKwM9){:target="_blank"} is our pick for the best prebuilt gaming PC for around $500. 

This PC has a Ryzen 3 1200 which is an overclocking beast. The stock cooler that ships with the CPU is awesome; out of the box you can easily overclock this chip from 3.1 GHz to 3.8 GHz, some even achieving 4.0 GHz with the stock cooling solution. 

This CPU alongside the Radeon RX 560 and 8GB of DDR4 2400 MHz RAM make a great budget gaming PC. Considering you're getting a PC of this quality and Windows 10 already installed, it's a good pick for budget conscious gamers. 

You can expect 50+ FPS in most titles 1080p resolution with high settings. If you're willing to turn down some settings to low-medium, this PC shouldn't have a problem running games at 60+ FPS.

**Pros:**

* Affordable gaming PC 
* Good performance
* Windows 10 included

**Cons:** 

* GPU only has 2GB of VRAM

The only drawback of this gaming PC is graphics card's total VRAM. It's only 2GB which isn't a lot for gaming in 2018 if you want 1080p, 60 FPS with high textures. 

Of course, this is to be expected on a budget like this especially with the extremely high cost of RAM and GPUs. Compared to a custom gaming PC, it's still a good deal. 

In addition, you can always upgrade the graphics card in the future once prices cool off a bit. If you're able to save up an extra $100 for our $600 prebuilt PC option, you'll see far better performance.

This video should give you an idea of the gaming performance you can expect with this gaming PC:

## [Dell Inspiron 5675 Gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2FHqfVe){:target="_blank"} - $600
<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2FHqfVe"><img class="img-small img-right" src="/img/prebuilt/600.png" /></a>

This $600 prebuilt gaming PC is one of my personal favorites. It looks great and more importantly, it can game like nobody's business. 

This PC can handle 1080p gaming with no problem. Expect to see 60 FPS in almost all titles with a mix of high-ultra settings. 

The power of the Ryzen 5 1400 CPU combined with the RX 570 with 4GB of VRAM is hard to beat. 

If you're looking for a PC that can game in 1080p, record, stream, edit, render, multitask and more, you're in luck because *this PC can do it all!*

**Pros:** 

* This PC is extremely cost effective 
* The Performance per dollar of this gaming PC is insane
* Good looking exterior 
* Windows 10 Included

**Cons:**

* Lacking an SSD, but at this budget it's perfectly understandable. In addition, it's easy to install one on your own!

## [CyberPowerPC Gamer Extreme](http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH){:target="_blank"} - ($700)

[This $700 gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH){:target="_blank"} from CyberPowerPC really packs a punch for its pricetag. 

You're buying a prebuilt gaming PC with Windows already installed, not to mention a one year parts and labor warranty with free lifetime tech support. 

It's a great value; if you tried to build this PC on your own *the parts would cost you nearly $1,000*

Oftentimes if the CPU in your PC isn't up to par, it'll bottleneck the GPU and cause sudden FPS drops. 

That won't be a problem here thanks to the dependability and power of the Intel i5-7400 CPU. It's a powerhouse that'll get the job done with time to spare. 

When this CPU is coupled with the power of the RX 580 4GB, it's pretty much game over. You'll see your FPS counter soar past 60 FPS with ultra settings, 1080p resolution. 

**Pros:**

* Amazing PC for the money
* Windows included
* Parts & labor warranty, lifetime tech support

**Cons:** 

* An SSD would've been nice, but this PC still kicks butt!

## [HP Pavillion Power Premium Gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2BRguS5){:target="_blank"} - $800

I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across the [Newest Flagship HP Pavilion Power Premium Gaming VR Ready Desktop](http://amzn.to/2BRguS5){:target="_blank"} gaming PC on Amazon for only $800. It has an AMD Radeon RX 580 which would cost you around $550 alone. 

Not only are you getting an amazing deal on the GPU, you're getting an amazing deal on the entire PC. *If you tried to build this PC yourself, it could cost you over $1,100.* This is easily the best value for the money of all the PCs on this list. 

The Ryzen 5 1400 is an outsanding chip which will have no problem handling 1080p gaming with the RX 580. In fact, this PC could even handle some VR gaming if you're interested in experiencing it. 

Furthermore, this PC not only features a 1TB mass storage drive, but a 256 GB SSD. This is awesome! When you load your Windows OS, drivers and a few games on the SSD, the computer operates FAR smoother and faster than if these files were being stored on the mechanical hard drive. 

Overall this PC is an absolute steal; I'm a bit jealous I don't own one myself!

## [SkyTech Omega Gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2DYQOou){:target="_blank"} - $1400 

This is my pick for the best overkill gaming PC. If you've got a lot of money to spend and you want to turn up every setting to the max while shredding the competition, this is the PC for you. 

Featuring an extremely powerful i7 CPU and a GTX 1060 6GB, this rig is a monster. 

**NOTE:** If you wait for GPU prices to cool off, you can build a gaming PC like this one with a *GTX 1070* which is far superior than the GTX 1060. Unfortunately due to cryptocurrency mining, a GTX 1070 is just ridiculously expensive. 

This PC has 16GB of DDR4 RAM, an SSD for your OS and games, as well as a water cooler which allows for extreme overclocking with your unlocked Intel i7 CPU.
