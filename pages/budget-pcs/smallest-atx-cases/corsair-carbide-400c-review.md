Corsair is a well-respected brand in the PC gaming community, and for good reason. 

From power supplies to cases, it seems like Corsair does it all. 

In this post, we're going to be taking a look at one of our favorite cases in their Carbide series line, the 400c.

## Case Design 

The 400C has a clean, modern, and minimalistic design with an entirely steel exterior. 

The overall design of the case feels sleek and refined. It has a nice black finish with a large side-panel window, allowing you to peek inside and take a look at your components. 

Although it's not flashy, when you step into the room, the case has a presence. 

Its minimalistic design is almost graceful in a way â€“ its visual points of interest are subtler compared to other flashy cases with bright lights that are dying for attention.

This case, on the other hand, knows it's good-looking, and doesn't have to show off to get the attention it deserves. 

On a more serious note, I'd like to talk about the actual design features of the case. 

The 400C measures 464 x 215 x 425mm (HxWxD) and weighs in at around 18 lbs. It's a smaller version of it's big brother, the 600C, but the case doesn't feel cramped. 

The outside of the 400C is mostly steel, but the door handle, feet, and ventilation dividers are made of plastic. Overall, the case is of a solid construction.

## Features 

In today's day and age, people are consuming their media much differently than they used to even a few years ago. 

Optical drives are becoming less common, as most of the data you'd need can be downloaded directly to your computer's hard drive, which have also grown in storage capacity. 

Moreover, rather than popping your favorite movie into the DVD player, most people choose to watch movies and TV shows via their favorite online streaming service, such as Netflix or Hulu.

Corsair has taken note of this shift, and decided to remove 5.25-inch optical drive bays entirely from this case. 

Although some people may be disappointed by this decision, in my opinion, it's actually a good choice. 

The case doesn't have optical drive bays, which frees up space for other things, including case fans, multiple GPUs, radiators, and extra space between hard drives which results in cooler temperatures. 

Moreover, the interior of the case is more spacious, which promotes better airflow. Lastly, the case can accomodate motherboards as large as E-ATX, which is pretty awesome. 

## Installation 

It comes with a pre-installed 140mm fan in the front. If you wish, you can remove the 140mm fan and install three 120mm case fans instead. 

You can even add another two 120mm or 140mm fans in the top of the case, or mount a water cooling radiator up to 360mm in size. 

The case supports up to five storage devices, two of which are 3.5-inch drives and two 2.5-inch drive bays for SSDs. 

The power supply and the removable 3.5-inch drive cage are both protected by overlapping plastic shrouds. When the plastic shrouds are there (they're removable), they hide most of the case's wiring, giving it a cleaner look and feel.

The case also has several cable cutouts, which are lined with rubber. 

There are three next to the motherboard tray. If you're installing a Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX board, you may find it difficult to use the cutouts all together. It really depends on the length of your cables. 

The 400C isn't a flashy case, but it's still a classy case with a low-profile. 

Despite its slightly smaller size, the case can hold a lot, thanks to Corsair's decision to get rid of 5.25-inch drive bays. 

The case doesn't have any fancy LED lighting, a common trait among gaming cases. However, it does ship with a nice side-panel window, and you can always add case fans with LEDs if you wish. 

I'd like this case a bit more if its cable cutouts were placed differently, as it's somewhat difficult to use them unless you have an ATX or E-ATX motherboard. 

Nevertheless, it's not the end of the world, and they get the job done. 

## Conclusion 

What's the moral of the story here? 

If you're hunting for the best smallest ATX case, the Corsair Carbide 400C should be a strong contender on your list of possible candidates.
