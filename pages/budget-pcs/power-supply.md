The importance of buying the right power supply cannot be overstated. 

That's why I've created this list of the best power supplies for gaming in 2018.

## What to Look for in a Gaming Power Supply 

**Wattage:** If you're looking for a power supply, the PSU's wattage should be the first thing you look out for. If you buy a power supply that can't power your systems componets, your PC will shut down or short out. You can use power supply calculators like [eXtreme Power](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator){: target="_blank"} to help you figure out how much wattage you need to power your rig. It'll give you an estimate of your rig's power consumption based on the components you're using. If your rig draws 400W, for example, the calculator will probably recommend a 450-500W power supply to ensure there is always sufficient power at maximum load. If you plan on overclocking, I'd recommend going for an even more powerful PSU, just to be safe.

**Efficiency:** Power supplies have different efficiency rating. All you need to know is the Plus ratings go 80+, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium. As you progress up the efficiency scale, you'll be saving energy. All power supply ratings are based on the [80 Plus Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Plus){: target="_blank"}. PSUs are rated on their energy efficiency, just like all other electrical components. If your PC is incredibly power hungry, buy an efficient power supply to save on your electric bill!

**Modular:** non-modular PSUs have all cables permanently attached. Semi-modular PSUs have some cables permanently attached (usually motherboard and CPU power cables), and others can be removed. Fully-modular PSUs allow you to remove all cables, if you wish to do so. Having a semi-modular or fully-modular power supply is ideal. Managing your cables is important to ensure your rig looks good and more importantly, to have good airflow. If there are a bunch of cables jammed inside a case, you'll have poor airflow. On the other hand, if you only use the cables you need, your PC will have better airflow. 

**Compatibility:** It would be unfortunate if you bought a power supply, only to find out it is not compatible with your case or your motherboard. Always do your research to ensure everything is compatible before buying! 

## Benefits of a Good Power Supply 

Buying a good power supply will provide you with many benefits, including: 

**Prevents damage to PC:** Having a high quality PSU will protect your components from shorting out and will ensure a long lifespan by providing stable power. 

**Reduces electric bill:** An efficient PSU will reduce your electric bill, which can become quite expensive if you're a serious gamer. 

**Future proofs your PC:** If you decide to add a second GPU in the future, or you want to overclock your build, you'll have to buy a powerful PSU to provide stable power, even after the increased demand.
