If you're reading this page, you've probably decided to build your own [budget gaming PC](/budget-pcs/) instead of buying a [prebuilt](/budget-pcs/prebuilt/) gaming computer. Bravo!

Building your own gaming computer is both humbling and educational – however, choosing the right parts for your PC can be difficult. 

That's why I've compiled this list of the best gaming motherboards. I'll be highlighting the best gaming motherboard for Pentium, i5, i7, and Ryzen CPUs. 

Keep reading to learn more about the best budget gaming motherboards!

## What Does a Motherboard Do? 

All of your PC's components are connected to your motherboard. To put it simply, your motherboard allows your PC components to communicate with one another. 

Without a motherboard, your PC parts wouldn't be able to do much of anything. 

The processor, RAM, graphics card, hard drives, optical drives, case fans, M.2 storage and SSDs, CPU coolers, etc. all connect to your motherboard.

![Motherboard Diagram](/img/mobo/mobo-diagram.jpg)
 
Different motherboards have different CPU socket types, and different chipsets. The socket type of your motherboard will be either AMD or Intel. Moreover, different Intel CPUs are compatible with certain socket types – the same goes for AMD.

For example, AMD Ryzen CPUs are only compatible with AM4 socket types, and Intel's newest line of 8th generation CPUs are only compatible with LGA 1151 sockets. 

Motherboard chipsets are also important. If you want to overclock your CPU, you'll have to make sure your motherboard has the right chipset. 

Intel Z370 chipsets are the best for overclocking, as they allow you to fully unlock your CPU's overclocking potential. Other chipsets, such as an Intel H370, for example, are more restrictive when it comes to overclocking. 

There are so many things you have to consider when buying your motherboard, including size, number of fan connectors and its power rating, the socket type, chipset, how many PCI slots it has, RAM slots, maximum RAM frequency, maximum RAM capacity, etc. 

As you can probably tell, it can quickly become overwhelming, especially for those who are new to the PC gaming community.

That's why I've created this list of the 5 best gaming motherboards. If you choose one of the motherboards on this list, you really can't go wrong.

So, keep reading to find the right motherboard for you! 

## [Best Motherboard for Overclocking: MSI Pro Z270 SLI PLUS ATX Intel Motherboard](https://amzn.to/2uU6eXQ){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uU6eXQ"><img alt="MSI Pro Z270 SLI PLUS" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/mobo/msi-pro-z270-plus.png" /></a>

This ATX motherboard has an LGA 1151 socket type, which is compatible with Intel's newest line of processors. It's also sporting an Intel Z270 chipset, which means you can fully unlock your CPU's overclocking potential. 

Four 3800MHz DDR4 RAM slots can accomodate up to 64GB of memory. The motherboard also has 3 PCI-E x16 slots, and 3 PCI-E x1 slots. 

this motherboard is a workhorse, and its [SLI](https://www.geforce.com/whats-new/guides/introduction-to-sli-technology-guide){: target="_blank"} branding means it was designed with gaming in mind. 

The motherboard's southbridge and northbridge are both protected by heatsinks. The motherboard doesn't have any RGB lighting, but that's okay. 

Instead, the motherboard has white lights on the back of the board, and an RGB light header (the header allows you to plug in your own custom RGB lighting, if you choose to do so.)

Although the motherboard doesn't look flashy, it surely packs a punch.

The motherboard has two M.2 sockets and six Sata 3 ports. It supports two-way SLI and three-way crossfire. Most people don't need more than two GPUs. 

From a performance standpoint, the MSI Z270 SLI Plus is powerful and reliable. The board has good application speeds and great storage read/write speeds as well. Its CrstalDiskMark read and write speeds of 514MB/s and 500MB/s, just behind high end motherboards. 

For the price of this board, it's a steal. It's not flashy, but it does offer solid performance at a fair price. 

## [ASUS ROG Strix H370-F Gaming Motherboard](https://amzn.to/2JJydy){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JJydyG"><img alt="ASUS ROG Strix H370-F Gaming Motherboard" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/mobo/asus-rog-strix-h370-f.jpeg" /></a>

H370 chipsets are generally cheaper than Z370 chipsets. However, they don't offer the same overclocking potential.

They are full-featured motherboards with less of an emphasis on overclocking capabilities. If you want to overclock your CPU with an H370 motherboard, you won't be able to surpass Intel's default Turbo boot for the chip. 

The maximum turbo frequency of RAM is 2,666 MHz, and you can't run two graphics cards in SLI format. 

On the other hand, they're perfect for the average Joe looking to build a simple gaming PC. They surely get the job done, and better still, they're simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. 

Despite their lack of overclocking potential, they still offer good performance at a fair price. 

H370 chipsets support Intel's newest line of 8th generation Coffee Lake CPUs. You can also use M.2 drives and USB 3.1 Gen2. 

The [ASUS ROG Strix H370-F gaming motherboard](https://amzn.to/2JJydy){: target="_blank"} has two M.2 PCIe slot, USB 3.1, RGB lighting, and high quality audio. For the price, it's packed with nice features. 

The motherboard has six SATA ports that are lined up individually, which is a bit odd (most motherboards have them stacked atop one another.) 

Unless you're serious about overclocking, this motherboard is probably a great fit for your next build. If you do choose an unlocked Intel CPU, however, go for a Z370 chipset instead. 

## [Best Budget Gaming Motherboard: Gigabyte Aorus GA-AX370 Gaming 5 ATX AMD Motherboard](https://amzn.to/2O5kDsS){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2O5kDsS"><img alt="gigabyte-aorus-ga-ax370" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/mobo/gigabyte-aorus-ga-ax370.jpg" /></a>

The [Gigabyte Aorus GA-AX370 Gaming 5](https://amzn.to/2O5kDsS){: target="_blank"} comes in at $170 on Amazon. It is a bit more expensive than other AM4 motherboards, but for good reason.

It has a Z370 chipset, which is the best for overclocking. It is the only chipset that allows you to fully unlock your CPU's overclocking potential, and it is compatible with AMD's newest Ryzen CPUs. 

By the way, Ryzen CPUs are well known for their unrivaled overclocking performance. They're okay at stock frequencies, but they're champions when overclocked. 

With that being said, you'll probably want a motherboard with a Z370 chipset, which is designed specifically for overclocking.

The motherboard has two LED headers, modest overclocking potential and a VRM heatsink assembly. It has three M.2 slots (in case you're not familiar, M.2 is an even faster f orm of storage than SSDs.)

The board has 10-phase CPU power delivery, and memory support up to 4133MHz. Keep in mind, however, that [RAM](/budget-pcs/ram/) at this speed is both expensive and unnecessary for gaming. 

Processor speeds almost surpass 5GHz, which is both impressive and important if you're interested in overclocking (which you should be).

The motherboard is reliable, great for overclocking, and modestly priced. I'd highly recommend this board if you're going to include an AMD Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 CPU in your next gaming PC build.
