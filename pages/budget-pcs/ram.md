## [G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 2400MHz RAM](https://amzn.to/2A2fGOv){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2A2fGOv"><img alt="G Skill Ripjaws V 2x4GB RAM" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/ram/g-skill-ripjaws-v.jpg" /></a>

If you're looking for a great mid-range RAM kit, [G.Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 2400MHz RAM](https://amzn.to/2A2fGOv){: target="_blank"} is your best bet. It's fast, reliable – and best of all – it's cheap. 

Ripjaws V Series Kit are 288-pin RAM sticks that can be run in a dual-channel configuration for even faster speeds. You can purchase this RAM in five different colors, including Radiant Silver, Blazing Red, Gunmetal Gray, Steel Blue, and Classic Black. 

The neweset generation of RAM from G.Skill is both faster and more affordable. It's the perfect choice for budget builders, from a [$400](/budget-pcs/400/) budget to an [$800](/budget-pcs/800/) budget. 

G.Skill is one of the best RAM manufacturers in the industry, especially when it comes to gaming. Their RAM often outperforms the competition at a lower price. The Ripjaws V series is no exception. The RAM overclocks well, too. 

If you're on a tight budget, 8GB of RAM will suffice. 

On the other hand, if you have a bit of extra cash on hand, I'd recommend going for a 16GB kit. Although 8GB of RAM will get the job done, 16GB is ideal.

Many new games are starting to recommend 12GB to 16GB of RAM, not to mention the extra RAM also helps with multitasking. 

For example, Google Chrome consumes a whole lot of RAM. I only have 8GB in my build, and I usually have to close my tabs on Google Chrome before launching a game in order to achieve optimal performance.

## [Corsair Dominator Platinum](https://amzn.to/2uWUvrk){: target="_blank"}

Corsair is often at the top of list for most people, as they consistently and reliably produce amazing products. Their Dominator Platinum series has remained largely popular, due to the incredibly performance of this RAM kit. 

The Dominator Series features Corsair's DHX cooling technology, which allows for stable temperatures when overclocked at high frequencies. 

Overclocking is effortless with Intel's [Z270 motherboards](/budget-pcs/motherboard/). Simply change the frequency divider in the BIOS. 

Although the kit is on the expensive side, the Corsair Dominator series is probably the best RAM on the market. If you're interested in overclocking, or you want the best possible performance out of your new gaming rig, this is the RAM for you. 

The RAM provides superb cooling, thanks to their heavy heatsink. 

According to [Think Computers](https://thinkcomputers.org/corsair-dominator-platinum-ddr4-3200-16gb-memory-kit-review/){: target="_blank"}: 

<blockquote source="https://thinkcomputers.org/corsair-dominator-platinum-ddr4-3200-16gb-memory-kit-review/">
<p>When it comes to performance this kit is great! As a reminder this is the CMD16GX4M2B3200C16 kit which is a 16 GB (2x 8GB) kit that runs at 3200 MHz with timings of 16-18-18-36 at 1.35V. It performed great in all of our tests and currently sits as the best performing DDR4 memory kit we’ve tested to date! On top of that we were able to bring to kit up from its default speed of 3200 MHz all the way up to 3466 MHz without having to adjust timings or voltage! When it comes to DDR4 that is very impressive!</p>

If you buy Corsair's Dominator series RAM, you will not be disappointed.

## [G.Skill TridentZ RGB](https://amzn.to/2JLn4gN){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JLn4gN"><img alt="g skill tridentz rgb" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/ram/g-skill-tridentz-rgb.png" /></a>

If you're a fan of RGB lighting, this is the RAM kit for you. It defintely adds personality to your gaming PC, as long as your case has a side panel window. 

G.Skill announced TridentZ RGB memory in December. Now, it is available in nearly every capacity, speed, and latency one could ask for. 

The RAM utilizes RGB diodes that emit bright and playful color. 

Of course, looks aren't everything – this RAM passed all of my tests with flying colors. It's clocked at 3200MHz, which is great for gaming. It also has good overclocking potential, thanks to its effective heatsink. 

Be ready to pay extra for the fancy RGB lighting. Personally, I'd prefer standard RAM without flashy lights. It'll get the job done just the same (if not better), and you'll save some money. On the other hand, if you want to spice up your build with cool colors, this is the RAM for you.
