## What Is a Gaming Keypad

A gaming keypad is basically a small keyboard designed specifically for gaming. It has less keys than a standard keyboard, and they are arranged in a more ergonomic fashion for gaming. 

Unlike the mouse, which has been continually improved upon over the years, keyboards have remained relatively the same. 

Recently, however, many companies have begun to create mini-keyboards, designed to improve the PC gamer's experience. These devices are known as gaming keypads. 

## Why Should You Consider a Gaming Keypad? 

The benefits of a gaming keypad cannot be overstated: 

* **Ergonomic Design:** Most gaming keypads have been designed to provide a more comfortable alternative to a traditional gaming keyboard. Gaming keypads reduce fatigue after hours of gameplay. Moreover, they can be a safer way to play video games – that is, gaming keypads are more [ergonomic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ergonomics){: target="_blank"}, reducing the risk of hand injury that can occur from gaming for a prolonged period of time. 

* **Smaller Form Factor:** If you want more desk space, or you're looking for a device that can comfortably rest on your lap, you'll probably find a gaming keypad incredibly beneficial. 

* **Controls at Your Finger Tips:** All of the buttons on a gaming keypad are laid out in a manner that allows you to easily access each one without having to strain your hand or reach too far. 

## [Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB Gaming Keypad](https://amzn.to/2ul8WpM){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ul8WpM"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB Gaming Keypad" src="/img/gaming-keypad/razer-tartarus.png" /></a>

**1.** The [Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB gaming keypad](https://amzn.to/2ul8WpM){: target="_blank"} is an excellent gaming keypad. It has 15 programmable keys, which are individually customizable. 

The keypad is composed of three different sections: a keypad, a moldest wrist-rest, and a thumb-control module. The keypad is designed for left handed use only, and provides superb wrist and palm support. 

The Tartarus has rubber feet not only to keep the keypad in place, but also to protect your desk from scratches and damage. 

The keypad's 15 programmable buttons are laid out in three rows of five keys. The center keys are set by default to WASD controls, but they can be reconfigured to your liking.

Every key is numbered, and glow with a green backlight, allowing you to play throughout the night. The keys are not mechanical – instead, they are constructed with silicone dome switches. 

On the right side of the device, there are two thumb-buttons and an 8-position thumb-stick. 

The keypad is compatible with Razer's Synapse 2.0 cloud-connected dashboard, a convenient tool for customizing your device. 

All of the buttons on the keypad, including the 15 keys, two thumb buttons and the 8-position thumb-pad, can be tweaked and customized. In fact, you switch between 8 different keymaps. 

The Tartarus offers fantastic control. The wrist-support keeps your hand and wrist comfortable, even after hours of gameplay. 

Overall, the Razer Tartarus is a superb gaming keypad. 

## [Razer Tartarus V2 Chroma Gaming Keypad](https://amzn.to/2mfE31l){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2mfE31l"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Tartarus V2 Gaming Keypad" src="/img/gaming-keypad/razer-tartarus-v2.png" /></a>
		
**2.** The [Razer Tartarus V2 Chroma gaming keypad](https://amzn.to/2mfE31l){: target="_blank"} has 25 programmable keys and a directional stick. It also features a full range of RGB lighting that is entirely customizable. 

If you'r looking for a gaming keypad, the Tartarus V2 Chroma surely getes the job done. Although a gaming keypad is not incredibly useful for casual or FPS gamers, it is especially useful if you're an MMO fan. 

You can adjust the V2's hand rest to one of two positions. The S key has a small notch to help you identify the key by touch, rather than having to look at it. This feature is especially useful, but not uncommon among traditional keyboards. 

The keys rest atop Razer's mecha-membrane – although they aren't as crisp as mechanical keys, the mecha-membrane is still responsive. 

You can switch between three keymaps, which is convenient if you use different characters in MMO games. This is, without question, an MMO device. 

## [Razer Orbweaver Chroma - Elite RGB Gaming Keypad](https://amzn.to/2JlQOAS){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JlQOAS"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Orbweaver Chroma - Elite RGB " src="/img/gaming-keypad/razer-orbweaver.png" /></a>


**3.** The [Razer Orbweaver Chroma - Elite RGB gaming keypad](https://amzn.to/2JlQOAS){: target="_blank"} provides the best thumb controls available, 20 programmable keys, and several adjustable parts for a comfortable gaming experience. 

It has rubber padded feet, and three adjustable parts: the wrist rest, a thumb module with a joystick and two thumb buttons, and lastly, the keypad with 20 programmable buttons. 

You'll enjoy easy access to all of the controls on this device, allowing you to game all throughout the day (or night) without straining your wrist, or your hand. 

The center buttons are programmed to the WASD keys, but can be reprogrammed to your liking. The keys are mechanical, so they feel crisp and responsive – moreover, the keys are also backlit, allowing you to game during the night time. Oh, and it looks cool, too. 

Unfortunately, the backlight is not customizable, but rather it remains a bright green color. However, you can adjust the brightness. 

There is no tacticle distinction between the WASD keys, which I found to be a bit of a pain in the neck. There is an incredibly small bump on the S key, but it's too small to make much of a difference. 

The Orbweaver's thumb controls have been improved upon when compared to its predecessor, the Razer Nostromo. The joystick is positioned in a comfortable position for your thumb – in fact, I definitely enjoy using it. 

The gaming keypad is comfortable and adjustable, to accomodate different gamers accordingly. Additionally, the buttons on the device are all programmable with Razer's Synapse 2.0 dashboard. You can remap keys and select different keymaps. This feature is especially useful when you're switching characters in an MMO, or switching games altogether. 

My overall opinion of this gaming keypad is stupendous! 

## [Logitech G13 Gaming Keypad](https://amzn.to/2LfcPmr){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LfcPmr"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB Gaming Keypad" src="/img/gaming-keypad/logitech-g13.png" /></a>

**4.** *What's this? A gaming keypad that is not made by Razer?!* Yes, now we're taking a look at a gaming keypad made by Logitech. In fact, the [Logitech G13 gaming keypad](https://amzn.to/2LfcPmr){: target="_blank"} is one of my favorites on this list. 

The designers clearly had ergonomics in mind when they created this gaming keypad. Boasting 22 programmable buttons with interchangeable maps and profiles, onboard memory, comfort, and above all, control, the Logitech G13 is a strong contender. 

If you're looking for all of the benefits of a traditional gaming keyboard without the bulk, the Logitech G13 is the gaming keypad for you. 

The G13 has four sections: the wrist and palm rest, the keypad, the analog mini-joystick, and a display. It connects to your computer via a 7 foot long [USB 2.0](https://www.diffen.com/difference/USB_2.0_vs_USB_3.0){: target="_blank"} cable. 

Your fingers naturally rest in the proper position thanks to this keypad's ergonomic design. Each key is contoured, and the default WASD keys have bumps to help you locate them with touch rather than sight. Unlike the Razer Orbweaver, these bumps are easily noticeable. 

Also unlike the Orbweaver, this keypad's backlighting color is entirely customizable. 

The LCD screen can be used for macro recording, and monitoring your [CPU](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CPU.html){: target="_blank"} and RAM usage. You can also use it as a stopwatch, or as an RSS reader. 

The device is not plug and play. It comes with a software disc that you'll need to use to install drivers. 

In conclusion, the Logitech G13 is an incredibly comfortable, well-performing gaming keypad. You can customize it to your liking. Overall, it is easily one of the best gaming keypads on the market, if not the best. 

## [Best Budget Gaming Keypad: DELUX T9](https://amzn.to/2unjaWv){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2unjaWv"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB Gaming Keypad" src="/img/gaming-keypad/delux-t9.jpg" /></a>

The [DELUX T9 46-Key gaming keypad](https://amzn.to/2unjaWv){: target="_blank"} is a Kailh blue swtich keyboard. After using the keyboard, I found the keys to be clicky and responsive. 

The keypad has a large wrist and palm wrest, which is incredibly comfortable, even after hours of gaming. On the left of the wrist and palm wrest, there is a triangular space button. It may sound strange, but it actually feels natural during gameplay. 

It is a backlit gaming keypad, and the backlight color can be configured without the use of a computer or software. Its WASD keys are red, and the rest of the keys on the keypad are black, with the exception of the red spacebar. 

This gaming keypad is the perfect blend of comfort and affordability.

## Choosing the Right Gaming Keypad

If you're in the market for a gaming keypad, you probably want to find the best gaming keypad for your money. It really all comes down to personal preference. Before you buy, keep the following in mind: 

* **Key Type:** You'll have to decide whether you want a mechanical or membrane gaming keypad. Many prefer mechanical keys, but they are often more expensive and noisy. Mechanical keys need not be pressed all the way to register, which is why they are often the preferred key type. Membrane keys, on the other hand, are cheaper, which is their primary benefit. 

* **Game Genre:** Whether or not you choose a gaming keypad is heavily dependent on the types of games you enjoy playing. If you're an FPS fan, a gaming keyboard is probably your best bet. Although, if you're an MMO gamer, you'll probably find a gaming keypad far more useful. You can program every key to your liking, and program multiple profiles and keymaps.
