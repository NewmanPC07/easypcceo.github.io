Did you know that *around 1,800 new Bitcoins are mined every day?* 

There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. It would be wise to acquire some Bitcoin while you still can.

Blockchain technology is in, and it's here to stay.

In this guide, we're going to be talking about the best cryptocurrency mining hardware on the market. 

## Most Popular Cryptocurrencies:

### Bitcoin Mining Hardware

![BITCOIN](/img/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-logo.png "BITCOIN"){: .img-small .img-right}

In today's economy, every transaction we make goes through a bank or credit card company. 

They take a cut of the transaction, and we must believe that they won't make a mistake. 

That's where <a target="_blank" href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> comes in. 

Bitcoin is rallying after a seemingly infinite bear market. 

As time moves on, Bitcoin will be harder to mine, supply will be capped, and price should continue to increase.

If you want to start mining Bitcoin now, check out our guide!

### 2. Ethereum 

![ETHEREUM](/img/cryptocurrency/ethereum-logo.png "ETHEREUM"){: .img-right .img-small}

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a platform specifically designed for people to build decentralized applications on their blockchain. 

In fact, most of the tokens on [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/){: target="_blank"} are ERC-20 tokens, meaning they run on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum's traditional mining algorithm – which used Proof of Work to validate blocks – is being replaced by a new Proof of Stake system.

Proof of Stake doesn't require miners with physical mining hardware, so Ethereum mining isn't going to be around for much longer. 

However, you can still mine Ethereum for now. 

### 3. Litecoin 
![LITECOIN](/img/cryptocurrency/litecoin-logo.png "LITECOIN"){: .img-small .img-right }

<a target="_blank" href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> is a decentralized cryptocurrency. There is a finite amount in existence, only 84 million. 

It has low transaction fees and fast transaction times. It can be bought and sold between both people and exchanges. 

Lastly, it can be spent on almost anything.

### 4. Dash 

![DASH](/img/cryptocurrency/dash.jpg "DASH"){: .img-right .img-small}

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dash.org/">Dash</a> is the first form of digital cash that works like physical cash. 

You hold your own money, maintaining full control. You maintain total privacy, and your transactions can't be tracked. 

Furthermore, transactions are instantaneous. 

Fees are virtually non-exisistent, as you control your own money.

![MONERO](/img/cryptocurrency/monero-logo.png){: .img-right .img-small}
### 5. Monero

[Monero](/crypto-mining/monero-hardware/) is focused on fungibility and the privacy of its users. 

It's an awesome project and a great token.

Best of all, Monero can even be mined by the 'poor man' without enough money for expensive mining hardware.

That's because its Cryptonight mining algorithm can be mined with both GPUs and desktop CPUs.

### 6. Zcash 

![ZCASH](/img/cryptocurrency/zcash.png "ZCASH"){: .img-right .img-small}

<a target="_blank" href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> is based on <a target="_blank" href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>, but has one key difference: 

Unlike bitcoin, Zcash gives the user the option to encrypt the transaction. 

This means that the sender address, recipient address, and the amount sent is hidden from public view. 

Many would consider Zcash the future of anonymous transaction. Regular GPUs can be used to mine Zcash, such as the [GTX 1080](/crypto-mining/gtx-1080-review/)!

NOTE: There will only ever be 21 million coins, so start mining NOW!

The [AMD Radeon R9 295X2](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338114702&customid=&icep_uq=radeon+r9+295x2&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"} is one of the best mining GPUs on the market. Boasting an ETH hashrate of 45 MH/s and drawing 500W from the wall, this GPU is the most powerful Ethereum miner on the market.

The 295X2 has 8GB of dedicated video memory, which is crucial for ETH mining. As time goes on, the amount of dedicated video memory will steadily increase, so it's important to buy a GPU like the R9 295X2 that has a lot of memory.

If you want to generate serious revenue mining Ethereum, consider running multiple R9 295X2 GPUs in an Ethereum mining rig. 

The R9 295X2 is also a proficient [Monero mining GPU](/crypto-mining/monero-hardware/). You'll be able to profitably mine various cryptocurrencies with this card. 

## [AMD Radeon RX 480](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338114702&customid=&icep_uq=radeon+rx+480&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"}

Ethereum is a profitable cryptocurrency to mine, meaning the Radeon RX 480 is a worthy investment. 

The RX 480 has an Ethereum hashrate of around 25 MH/s and draws 150W from the wall. Even though it has a lower hashrate than the R9 295X2, it also has a lower power consumption. The R9 295X2 is a powerful miner, but you'll end up spending more on electricity with that card. 

The RX 480 provides a great balance of power and efficiency, both of which are important traits of a cryptocurrency mining GPU. The RX 480 is also great for mining Monero, ZCash, etc. 

## [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338326883&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1070&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"}

The [GTX 1070](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338326883&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1070&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"} has a hashrate of around 30 MH/s. This is one of the best cryptocurrency mining GPUs because it has a good balance of hashrate and power consumption, only drawing 150W from the wall.  

Unfortunately, the GTX 1070 is an expensive GPU. Although it's easily one of the most profitable mining GPUs on the market, you'll have to invest upfront. However, in the long run, this GPU is well worth the investment. If you're able to run multiple GTX 1070 GPUs in a cryptocurrency mining rig, you'll make a killing.

Remember, you'll make more money if you mine where electricity is cheap. That's why the majority of cryptocurrency mining is done in China. On the other hand, the GTX 1070 is a profitable mining GPU no matter where you live.

Out of the box, the [AMD RX Vega 56](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338326883&customid=&icep_uq=amd+rx+vega+56&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"} gets around 36 MH/s.

The RX Vega 56 performs well, but compared to other GPUs on the market, it probably isn't worth your money. As of now, the Vega 56 is quite expensive. Moreover, it draws a considerable amount of power, making it an expensive GPU to run 24/7 in a mining rig. 

If you already have an RX Vega 56 for gaming, it is definitely a profitable way to mine cryptocurrency. However, if you are already in the market for a new GPU, particularly for cryptocurrency mining, I'd recommend choosing one of the more profitable alternatives in this list.

The [AMD Radeon HD 7990](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338114702&customid=&icep_uq=radeon+hd+7990&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: target="_blank"} is a good budget mining GPU. 

The HD 7990 achieves 36 MH/s while drawing 375W from the wall. It's not quite as profitable as the Radeon RX 480 or the GTX 1070, but it still gets the job done. The card has three fans as opposed to just two, which allows for superior cooling. 

It's important to note that the HD 7990 is a long graphics card – make sure the GPU fits in your case before you buy it! If you'd like the best cooling possible, considering mounting your GPUs in a cryptocurrency mining rig rather than inside a traditional case. The rack mounts allow for better airflow, and they have more space for multiple mining GPUs. The more GPUs you have, the more profitable your mining operation will be! 

## Crypto Mining Guide 

This guide will teach you the basics of mining for cryptocurrencies and [crypto transactions](https://bitcoinfy.net/crypto-transactions-and-mining/){: target="_blank"}.

These are the 3 MOST important parts of a cryptocurrency mining PC: 

* The Graphics Card 
* The Motherboard
* The Power Supply 

Here's the deal:

Originally, the CPU was used to mine for cryptocurrencies.

However, very early on, miners discovered that the CPU was not very efficient for mining. 

In fact, it was virtually useless. 

Instead? 

The graphics card is used for solving the complex algorithms that form cryptocurrency. 

## How Mining Works 

Cryptocurrency mining may seem complicated, but it's really quite simple.

Let's say Bob sends one Bitcoin to Bill. The transaction, like all other crypto transactions, is announced to everyone on the Bitcoin network. The transaction is posted on a huge database known as the **blockchain**, also commonly referred to as the **ledger**. 

Everyone can see the sender wallet address, recipient wallet address, and the amount of Bitcoins sent. However, the sender's name, location, etc. are kept private. 

Everyone has their own copy of the blockchain, and everyone compares their information to ensure they have the same thing. 

The network is legitimized by miners. Different currencies use different algorithms, Bitcoin's algorithm being SHA-256. Miners use their computer hardware (GPUs or ASICs) to rapidly guess and check solutions to the algorithm. It's so difficult that it'd be next to impossible for humans to solve it. 

The faster the GPU can guess and check solutions, the more likely it is to successfully solve the problem. When this happens, a block reward is received. This means the miner who successfully solves the block receives 12.5 Bitcoins directly deposited into their mining wallet. 

![Mining Image](/img/cryptocurrency/mining.jpg)

Your GPU also consumes electricity. It's important to make sure your GPU has a high hashrate and low power consumption, as this ratio really determines your profits. If you pay more in electricity than you generate in mined cryptocurrency, you'll lose money! 

It takes about 10 minutes for miners to verify one block. Every time a block is added to the blockchain, the previous layer is sealed off. This ensures the same person can't send the same Bitcoin twice.  

There are only 21 million Bitcoins that can exist, and currently about 16 million have been mined. Every 210,000 blocks, the block reward splits in half. When Bitcoin first came out, the block reward was 50 Bitcoins. 210,000 blocks later it became 25 Bitcoins, and now it's 12.5 Bitcoins. 

As the block reward halves, theoretically the price of Bitcoin (or whatever currency you're mining) should increase accordingly. Once all Bitcoin are mined, the price should be much higher. At this point in time, miners will receive rewards in the form of transaction fees which are deducted from every transaction. 

This ensures the mining incentive is generally the same at all times. Cryptocurrencies couldn't exist without miners!

## Importance of a Powerful and Efficient GPU 

Considering the information above, the importance of a powerful GPU is clear. The more powerful your GPU is, the faster you'll successfully mine coins. 

However, powerful cards tend to use lots of electricity. That's why the efficiency of a card is equally important to consider. Sometimes, it's better to buy multiple low end GPUs with a great power/hash ratio. It may yield higher profits. The [GTX 1050 Ti](/crypto-mining/gtx-1050ti-review/) is a perfect example.

With the difficulty of mining increasing each day, an efficient GPU is critical. Some GPUs cost more in electricity than they generate in revenue. You can find efficient mining GPUs with the guides above. 

It's important to find a good cooling solution if you're interested in cryptocurrency mining, as your GPU(s) will get very hot. Check out our guide on the [best case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/)!

## Factors that Affect the Efficiency of your GPU 

You can't mine with any old graphics card.  

There are important stats to be considered including: 

* MHash/s 
* MHash/j
* MHash/s/$ 

### MHash/s 

MHash/s is equal to the amount of number-crunching the card can do while mining. If your hash rate is high, you'll go through hashes faster than if your hash rate was low. 

What does this mean for you? 

A higher hash rate equals faster results.

### MHash/j

MHash/j is the amount of hashes the card can process per joule of energy. If you didn't already know, mining uses a lot of electricity. It is important that your graphics card can mine enough for you to make a profit after you've paid your electricity bill. 

A higher number means your card is more power efficient. If your card is more power efficient, you'll save money on electricity. I'm sure you see where this is going. 

### MHash/s/$

MHash/s/$ is basically a way for you to see the price to performance ratio of the card. If the number is higher, it means you are getting more for your money. A card that uses too much electricity with a low hash rate won't generate much revenue, if any at all. 

It is important to make sure you find a card with a good balance of these stats for the right price. 

Mining for cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum, requires a powerful graphics card. 

Actually, it requires multiple powerful graphics cards. Consequently, you will also need a motherboard with enough PCI slots to house these graphics cards. 

Lastly, using the right power supply is crucial. If your mining rig is not provided sufficient power, it will short out. 

## Is Mining The Right Choice for You? 

Mining may sound like a great idea. Just get a mining GPU, and let the profits roll in. 

Right? 

Not necessarily. 

There are huge mining warehouses in countries with extremely low electricity cost. These warehouses have thousands of mining GPUs, and cost hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. 

On such a huge scale, mining is extremely profitable and the investors are making lots of money. However, when mining with one or two GPUs in your house, you might not see a great return on your investment, if anything at all. 

Mining still has its benefits. Some miners are doing so as a hobby that pays them something in return. However, unless you're doing it on a large scale, you probably won't see much profit. If you just want cryptcurrency, we recommend you [buy them.](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"}

## Cryptocurrency Mining Profitability 

Mining cryptocurrency is not as profitable as it was back in January of 2018 – the cryptocurrency market has retraced around 50% from where it was just 6 months ago. 

Although, that does not mean mining cryptocurrency is not profitable. With the right mining hardware, you can still generate passive income by mining cryptocurrency. 

Take a look at your projected earnings with a Radeon RX 480: 

![Current Mining Profitability](/img/cryptocurrency/profitability-today.png)

We're in the midst of a bearish market. Once the bulls return – and they will return – the crypto market cap will increase once again, and cryptocurrency mining will be even more profitable. It makes sense to acquire as much cheap cryptocurrency as you can while there's still time!

## Bitcoin Mining GPU 

If you're interested in buying a GPU for Bitcoin mining, I regret to inform you that you can't mine Bitcoin with a GPU. Once Bitcoin mining ASICs were developed, Bitcoin's mining difficulty skyrocketed. If you tried mining Bitcoin with a GPU, you'd never turn a profit. 

If you don't believe me, input any GPU's Bitcoin hashrate and power consumption into this [Bitcoin mining profitability calculator](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/btc?HashingPower=14&HashingUnit=MH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=150&CostPerkWh=0.12&MiningPoolFee=1){: target="_blank"}, and see for yourself. 

Don't get discouraged – you can buy a [Bitcoin mining ASIC](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/) to profitably mine Bitcoin! 

## Cryptocurrency Mining Pools 

If you're interested in maximizing your mining profits (why wouldn't you be?) then you should participate in a cryptocurrency mining pool. There's strength in numbers, especially when you're mining. 

Rather than trying to mine on your own, you can combine your hashing power with a bunch of other miners' hashing power. Then, all of you work together, which increases your odds of successfully validating a block. 

Once a block is verified, you receive a cut of the block reward that is proportional to the computational power that you contributed. For example, if you were responsible for 40% of the computational power, you'd receive 40% of the block reward, after pool fees. 

Here are some popular mining pools to consider: 

* [Antpool](https://antpool.com/)
* [BTC China](https://pool.btcc.com/)
* [BitFury](http://bitfury.com/)
