Mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has become very popular. 

With cryptocurrency values like this, it is easy to understand why many people are looking to get in on the action.  

As more and more begin to mine for cryptocurrency, it becomes harder and harder to successfully mine a bitcoin, litecoin, or any other form of cryptocurrency. 

This is why you need to START MINING NOW! 

## Top 5 Most Popular Cryptocurrencies:

### 5. Zcash

<a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a> is based on <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>, but has one key difference: 

Unlike bitcoin, Zcash gives the user the option to encrypt the transaction. 

This means that the sender address, recipient address, and the amount sent is hidden from public view. 

Many would consider Zcash the future of anonymous transaction. 

NOTE: There will only ever be 21 million coins, so start mining NOW!

### 4. Dash 

![DASH](/img/cryptocurrency/dash.jpg "DASH"){: .img-right .img-small}

<a href="https://www.dash.org/">Dash</a> is the first form of digital cash that works like physical cash. 

You hold your own money, maintaining full control. You maintain total privacy, and your transactions can't be tracked. 

Furthermore, transactions are instantaneous. 

Fees are virtually non-exisistent, as you control your own money.

<a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> is a decentralized cryptocurrency. There is a finite amount in existence, about 84 million. 

It has low transaction fees and fast transaction times. It can be bought and sold among other people, and through exchanges. 

Lastly, it can be spent on almost anything.

### 2. Ethereum 

![ETHEREUM](/img/cryptocurrency/ethereum-logo.png "ETHEREUM"){: .img-right .img-small}

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a platform specifically designed for people to build decentralized applications. 

It allows for peer-to-peer messaging, and a generalized blockchain. 

The blockchain has a built in programming language. This allows people to use the blockchain for any kind of decentralized application. 

It is online, and cryptographically secure.

### 1. Bitcoin

![BITCOIN](/img/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-logo.png "BITCOIN"){: .img-small .img-right}

In today's economy, every transaction we make must go through a bank or credit card company. 

They take a cut of the transaction, and we must believe that they won't make a mistake. 

That's where <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">bitcoin</a> comes in. 

At the heart of bitcoi]n, there is a mathematical problem. Miners solve these problems.

Every time a solution to the problem is solved, the reward is given as a bitcoin. 

Bitcoin, like other cryptocurrencies, is mined with powerful graphics cards.

## Crypto Mining Guide 

This guide will teach you the basics of mining for cryptocurrencies.

It will also show you the best mining PCs for the top 5 most popular cryptocurrencies today. 

These are the 3 MOST important parts of a cryptocurrency mining PC: 

* The Graphics Card 
* The Motherboard
* The Power Supply 

---

Here's the deal:

Originally, the CPU was used to mine for cryptocurrencies.

However, very early on, miners discovered that the CPU was not very efficient for mining. 

In fact, it was virtually useless. 

Instead? 

The graphics card is used for solving the complex algorithms that form cryptocurrency. 

## Factors that Affect the Efficiency of your GPU 

You can't mine with any old graphics card.  

There are important stats that need to be considered, including: 

* MHash/s 
* MHash/j
* MHash/s/$ 

### MHash/s 

MHash/s is equal to the amount of number-crunching the card can do while mining. If your hash rate is high, you'll go through hashes faster than if your hash rate was low. 

What does this mean for you? 

A higher hash rate equals faster results.

### MHash/j

MHash/j is the amount of hashes the card can process per joule of energy. If you didn't already know, mining uses a lot of electricity. It is important that your graphics card can mine enough for you to make a profit after you've paid your electricity bill. 

A higher number means your card is more power efficient. If your card is more power efficient, you'll save money on electricity. I'm sure you see where this is going. 

### MHash/s/$

MHash/s/$ is basically a way for you to see the price to performance ratio of the card. If the number is higher, it means you are getting more for your money. 

It is important to make sure you find a card with a good balance of these stats for the right price. 

Mining for cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum, requires a powerful graphics card. 

Actually, it requires multiple powerful graphics cards. Consequently, you will also need a motherboard with enough PCI slots to house these graphics cards. 

Lastly, using the right power supply is crucial. If your mining rig is not provided sufficient power, it will short out.
