Unlike other popular [cryptocurrencies](/crypto-mining/), there isn't an ASIC designed to mine Decred. For the time being, you'll have to stick with a mining [GPU](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining){:target="_blank"}. 

Currently, the most profitable Decred mining GPU is the [GeForce GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}. **Let's take a look at its specifications:**

* Architecture: Pascal
* Memory Speed: 11 Gbps
* Boost Clock: 1582 MHz
* Frame Buffer: 11 GB GDDR5X

As you can see, it's a pretty powerful card. Though it was originally designed for gaming, it's great for Decred mining. We're going to be taking a look at its overclocked performance, as that is the most profitable way to mine with this GPU.

The [GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) has a hashrate of 3793 MH/s when overclocked, and a power consumption of 216 watts (also overclocked). This is a pretty good hashrate/power consumption ratio. You'll see returns of nearly $1,000 per year. Remember, as the value of Decred rises, so do your projected earnings! 

## Decred Mining Profitability 

Currently, Decred mining seems to be quite profitable. **In fact, with the popularity of Decred on the rise, it's probably a good idea to start mining now.**

We used a mining calculator to project the annual return of the [GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg).

You can use [this mining calculator](https://whattomine.com/coins/152-dcr-blake-14r?utf8=%E2%9C%93&hr=3793&p=216&fee=0.0&cost=0.12&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate){:target="_blank"} to estimate your own mining performance. 

## What is Decred? 

Decred is an autonomous cryptocurrency. It has a consensus voting model which empowers stakeholders and allows for a seamless transition from one set of rules to another. That being said, it obviously has a strong focus on community input. 

It is a multi-platform digtal cryptocurrency, and supports Windows, MacOS and Linux. It has user-friendly wallet apps which allow you to send and receive with ease.

## Should You Invest in Decred? 

The popularity of Decred is on the rise. **Here's 4 reasons why Decred is worth your time (and money!):**

**1.** It has a great development team, possibly one of the best in the space

**2.** Decentralized governance allows Decred holders to vote on pre-coded forks

**3.** It uses a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work which mostly eliminates the weaknesses of each system on their own

**4.** Since it has a great development team, it attracts the best talent


## Decred Mining Pools 

Just like anything else, there's strength in numbers. Instead of mining on your own, why not team up with other miners and work together?

That's the basic idea of a mining pool. A group of miners all mine together. Once a blockchain reward is received, (in this case, Decred) each miner receives an equal portion of the work they put in. You're much more likely to successfully mine if you're a member of a minig pool. 

Here are some mining pools to consider: 

* [Supernova](https://dcr.suprnova.cc/)
* [CoinMine](https://www2.coinmine.pl/dcr/)
* [Pool.MN](https://pool.mn/dcr/)
* [DecredPool](http://www.decredpool.org/)
