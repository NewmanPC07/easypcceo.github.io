Menero is a cryptocurrency focused on fungibility and the privacy of its users. With the value passing the $40 mark, it may be time to consider investing in Monero mining harware. 

## Monero Mining Hardware 

Comparitively to [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware), there aren't any [ASIC](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ASIC-application-specific-integrated-circuit)s for mining Monero. 

However, there are other viable options. Your CPU and GPU can both be utilized to mine. 

Monero's mining algorithm uses a [Proof of Work](https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-proof-of-work/) system called CryptoNight. It was designed to be efficient with the harware of the casual user. 

The algorithm reduces the performance gap, in turn reducing the efficiency gap between GPUs and CPUs for mining. ASICs are not practical for mining Monero. 

If you want the most from your money, buying as many cheap CPUs is your best bet. 

**Here are some CPUs to consider:**

* [AMD Opteron 6272](http://amzn.to/2xz8OpM)
* [AMD FX 8320](http://amzn.to/2f6Gd3u)
* [AMD FX 8350](http://amzn.to/2f7G0No)
* [Xeon L5640](http://amzn.to/2xzPzMQ)
