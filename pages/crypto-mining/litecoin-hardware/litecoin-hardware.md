Okay, listen up:

This guide is going to provide you with the best Litecoin miner to maximize your profits. 

There are plenty of Litecoin ASICs out there, but not all Litecoin mining hardware was created equal. 

## What is Litecoin? 

Litecoin is faster than [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/), and focuses on smaller transactions. 

There will only ever be 84 million Litecoins mined. Some may disagree, but many draw the comparison that Litecoin is to Bitcoin as silver is to gold.

One of the key differences between Litecoin and [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/) is the 2.5 minute time to generate a block, opposed to Bitcoin's 10 minute [block time](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@ghayas/what-does-block-time-mean-in-cryptocurrency){:target="_blank"}.  

For miners, Litecoin's different mining algorithm also plays a big part. Litecoin uses scrypt, whereas Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm. 

Scrypt relies heavily on lots of high-speed Ram, and is often referred to as the 'memory hard problem'. [Vertcoin](/crypto-mining/vertcoin-hardware/) uses Scrypt too, but it implements the Adaptive N-Factor. You can read more about that [here](/crypto-mining/vertcoin-hardware/).

## The Best Litecoin Mining ASIC Hardware 
![Antminer L3+](/img/cryptocurrency/L3.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}


If you are interested in mining Litecoin, the best Litecoin mining hardware [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit){:target="_blank"} is probably the [Antminer L3+](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338145148&customid=&icep_uq=Antminer+L3%2B&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}. 

Mining is far more profitable when you use multiple ASICs. For large orders, or more information, please [contact me](/contact/). 

This miner is the fastest Litecoin mining ASIC on the market today. It can mine at a speed of **504 MH/s** with a max power consumption of **800 W**.

As we have seen with other popular cryptocurrencies such as [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/), [Monero](/crypto-mining/monero-hardware/), [Dash](/crypto-mining/dash-hardware/), [Zcash](/crypto-mining/zcash-hardware/), and [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware), mining profitability is always directly related with these factors.

This Antminer is very similar to the Antminer S9 series. However, it is a bit taller than the S9 and has four hashing boards instead of three. 

Each hashing board requires two PCI-E power connections and one forward controller. That makes nine power connections total.

## Powering the Antminer L3+

It is important to buy the right power supply for this miner, as it does not ship with a power supply included. 

The **Antminer APW5 power supply** is recommended. You can find it on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338114640&customid=&icep_uq=apw5+power+supply&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"} 

The APW5 power supply can provide up to 1300 W / 110 V or 2600 W over 205 V+. 

If you don't want this power supply and would prefer a more conventional power supply, the [EVGA Supernova 1050 GS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SOXNKAM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00SOXNKAM&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=de2675c9e53e633c7b9ee74a8e67e76f){:target="_blank"} is recommended and can be found on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SOXNKAM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00SOXNKAM&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=de2675c9e53e633c7b9ee74a8e67e76f){:target="_blank"}

Just make sure the PSU that you choose can provide at least 850 W with 9 6-pin PCI-E connectors, uses a single 12 V rail, and has a gold or platinum efficiency rating. 

NOTE: It would take over 500 top tier graphics cards to equal the hashing power of one [Antminer L3+](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338145148&customid=&icep_uq=Antminer+L3%2B&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}!  

## Expected Earnings w/ Antminer L3+

With earnings like this, it is a good idea to invest in the [Antminer L3+](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338145148&customid=&icep_uq=Antminer+L3%2B&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}. Keep in mind that the value of Litecoin is steadily increasing. This means you can expect an even faster return. 

These are highly sought-after miners. They are often out of stock, and are shipped out in batches. Keep your eye out for the next batch that is expected to ship, and pre-order early.

## Verdict: Should You Mine Litecoin?

Unfortunately, the bearish cryptocurrency market has had a negative impact on Litecoin mining profitability. 

If you buy a dedicated ASIC miner, there's a chance you won't turn a profit if your electricity cost is too high. 

Unless you have access to cheap electricity, mining may not be the best idea. 

However, because the market is low, it is currently a *great* time to buy Litecoin. \

You can buy Litecoin from a popular exchange such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/){: target="_blank"}. 

## Best Litecoin Mining Software

In order to mine Litecoin, you'll need to install mining software.

There are many different software options out there, so it can be tough to choose. 

You can follow [this guide](http://www.reviewoutlaw.com/how-to-mine-litecoins-on-windows/){:target="_blank"} to find and setup the best mining software for you!

## Practicality of Litecoin 

Litecoin, in most instances, is a more practical currency than Bitcoin. It can handle a higher volume of transactions due to its quick block generation. 

It also makes more sense in most cases to buy with Litecoin. 

For example, if one were to buy a charger online with a cryptocurrency, it makes more sense to buy it with .25 Litecoin instead of .000042 Bitcoin. However, most sites today have automatic converters that translate the currency of the local country into Bitcoin or Litecoin. 

## Should You Invest in Litecoin? 

If you are sceptical about getting involved with Litecoin, here are a few reasons why it's a good idea: 

* Litecoin has become very popular recently. This is because Litecoin is within 10% of activating [Segwit](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-segwit/){:target="_blank"} Segwit makes transactions faster and cheaper.

* Litecoin has been around since the very beginning, making it very trustworthy. In addition, you can track its value trends farther back, generating more reliable data. 

* Coinbase just added Litecoin. This makes Litecoin more accessible to many beginners with cryptocurrency. Whether or not you like Coinbase, it still opens the door to more potential users, which increases the value. 

* Since there will only ever be 84 million coins, you don't have to worry about inflation devaluing your currency. 

* It's easier to use Litecoin for smaller transactions 

All in all, Litecoin is a reliable cryptocurrency that we recommend investing in.

## Litecoin Mining Pools 

Mining pools are useful, even to the most experienced miners. They enhance the probability of successfully mining a coin.

Why only harness the power of one mining setup, when you can harness the power of all the setups in the mining pool? 

Mining pools are a great option for most people, especially those who may not have the most powerful mining rig. 

The idea of a mining pool is pretty simple. Instead of mining on your own, a group of people mine together. This makes the mining process faster. Once a coin is mined, all contributors receive a piece of the pie, directly proportional to their contribution. 

[Litecoinpool](https://www.litecoinpool.org/){:target="_blank"} is a popular Litecoin mining pool.

## Scrypt Mining Algorithm 

Litecoin's developers noticed a few things about Bitcoin: 

* Transactions took a long time
* Bitcoin wasn't practical for everyday transactions
* ASICs were centralizing the cryptocurrency 

They decided to create Litecoin, an alternative to Bitcoin. 

The token's creators implemented a new Proof-of-Work algorithm known as Scrypt. 

The development team saw what happened to Bitcoin – Bitmain and their ASICs deteriorated the network and caused block difficulty to increase far too quickly. 

Scrypt was designed to be ASIC resistant – unfortunately, after a while, ASICs were developed for Litecoin as well. 

In addition to being 'ASIC resistant', Litecoin was designed to have faster transaction speeds, therefore making it a practical alternative to Bitcoin for everyday transactions.
