This is the most efficient power supply on the market for this ASIC miner. 

The APW5 power supply can provide up to 1300 W / 110 V or 2600 W over 205 V+. 

If you don't want this power supply and would prefer a more conventional power supply, the [EVGA Supernova 1050 GS](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SOXNKAM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00SOXNKAM&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=de2675c9e53e633c7b9ee74a8e67e76f){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"}. is recommended and can be found on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SOXNKAM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00SOXNKAM&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=de2675c9e53e633c7b9ee74a8e67e76f){:target="_blank"}.

Just make sure the PSU that you choose can provide at least 850 W with 9 6-pin PCI-E connectors, uses a single 12 V rail, and has a gold or platinum efficiency rating. 

## Return on Investment
