## What is Litecoin? 

Litecoin is faster than Bitcoin, and is focused on smaller transactions. 

There will only ever be 84 million Litecoins mined. Litecoin is to Bitcoin as silver is to gold.

One of the key differences between Litecoin and [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/) is the 2.5 minute time to generate a block, opposed to Bitcoin's 10 minute time. 

For miners, Litecoin's different mining algorithm also plays a big part. Litecoin uses script, whereas Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm. 

Script relies heavily on lots of high-speed Ram, and is often referred to as the 'memory hard problem'.
