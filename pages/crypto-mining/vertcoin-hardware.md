Unlike other popular [cryptocurrencies](/crypto-mining/), there isn't an ASIC designed to mine Vertcoin. For the time being, you'll have to stick with a mining [GPU](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining){:target="_blank"}. 

Currently, the most profitable Vertcoin mining GPU is the [GeForce GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}. **Let's take a look at its specifications:**

* Architecture: Pascal
* Memory Speed: 11 Gbps
* Boost Clock: 1582 MHz
* Frame Buffer: 11 GB GDDR5X

We're going to be looking at the overclocked specs of this card. While the base clocks are still great for mining, you'll see higher profits when you've overclocked the GPU.

The [GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"} has a hashrate of 73 MH/s when overclocked, and a power consumption of 250 watts (also overclocked). This is a pretty good hashrate/power consumption ratio. **You'll see returns of nearly $2,200 per year**. Remember, as the value of Vertcoin rises, so do your projected earnings! 

## Vertcoin Mining Profitability 

Currently, Vertcoin mining seems to be quite profitable. **In fact, with the popularity of Vertcoin on the rise, it's probably a good idea to start mining now.**

We used a mining calculator to project the annual return of the [GTX 1080 Ti](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338234948&customid=&icep_uq=gtx+1080+ti&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}.

You can use [this mining calculator](https://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/vertcoin-mining-calculator/?h=73.00&p=250.00&pc=0.12&pf=0.00&d=43494.43785064&r=25.00000000&er=0.00047535&btcer=16623.72000000&hc=0.00){:target="_blank"} to estimate your own mining performance. 

## What is Vertcoin, and How Does it Differ from Bitcoin? 

Well, to start off, let's talk about Bitcoin. In the beginning, CPUs were used to mine for Bitcoin. It was quickly discovered that GPUs have FAR more mining power, and they were utilized for mining. 

Eventually, companies tried to monopolize mining by designing special hardware specifically designed for mining, known as ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). 

Since the creation of ASICs, the majority of Bitcoin mining is performed by large datacenters. 'Bitcoin Tycoons' if you will have giant warehouses in places like China where electricity is cheap. They have hundreds if not thousands of miners working 24/7. 

Vertcoin is like Bitcoin, but it has one major difference. The mining algorithm. 

Litecoin uses the [Scrypt](/crypto-mining/scrypt-hardware/) mining algorithm, originally set in place to resist the creation of ASIC miners. Of course, eventually an [ASIC miner for Litecoin](/crypto-mining/litecoin-hardware/) was developed as well. 

**Vertcoin is different**. It uses a new evolution of Scrypt known as "Adaptive N-Factor". The N-factor componenet determines the amount of memory needed for mining. It increases as time goes on to prevent the creation of any ASIC. 

This is good, as ASICs are bad for the mining community. Most people don't own, nor will they ever own an ASIC. In fact, once ASICs are developed, most of the mining is done by large mining companies/data centers. 

Vertcoin is a financial system owned by its users, not controlled by big mining companies. 

## Vertcoin Mining Pools 

Just like anything else, there's strength in numbers. Instead of mining on your own, why not team up with other miners and work together?

That's the basic idea of a mining pool. A group of miners all mine together. Once a blockchain reward is received, (in this case, Vertcoin) each miner receives an equal portion of the work they put in. You're much more likely to successfully mine if you're a member of a minig pool. 

**Here are some mining pools to consider:** 

* [Vertcoin Pool](https://poolmining.org/pool/vtc)
* [VTC Mining Pool Hub](https://vertcoin.miningpoolhub.com/)
* [Verters Pool](https://pool.verters.com/)

We strongly recommend checking out a Vertcoin mining pool. It's a great way to maximize your earnings.
