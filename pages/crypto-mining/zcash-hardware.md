## What is Zcash? 

Zcash uses proof of construction to secure the network. This allows it to maintain security without disclosing parties or amounts involved in the transaction. 

One huge benefit of Zcash is the ability of the user to choose whether or not they wish to encrypt their transaction. This way, transactions can be public, or private. It is totally up to you. 

Zcash is based on a decentralized blockchain, just like [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/). Zcash has caused lots of controversy, because it is set up as a company, not an opensource community.

Finding the right harware for mining Zcash can be difficult. It is important to balance the power of the GPU with the cost of the GPU and the cost of electricity. 

As we have seen with other popular cryptocurrencies such as [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/), [Monero](/crypto-mining/monero-hardware/), [Dash](/crypto-mining/dash-hardware/), [Litecoin](/crypto-mining/litecoin-hardware/), and [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware), mining profitability is always directly related with these factors. 

## Zcash Mining Hardware

Zcash uses equihash as its mining algorithm. Due to this, much like ethereum, the development of ASIC graphics cards for this cryptocurrency is unfeasible. 

That being said, here are the top 3 Best Zcash mining GPUs: 

## Sapphire Radeon RX 480

The [Sapphire Radeon RX 480](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAEFAHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01NAEFAHC&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=6237ff99f7e40f32ccc8ecd04c4f515b) is a card that should never be overloooked. One would be wrong to dismiss the AMD RX 400 series graphics cards, as they are a powerful tool in a miner's tool belt.

Much to the dismay of the modern day gamer, AMD graphics cards are amazing at mining for Zcash. 

The RX 480, after a few tweaks, can easily generate 27 MH/s. It only draws 150 watts at max load, making it an efficient and powerful choice for miners. 

Due to the effectiveness of this card, it is out of stock quite often. Now is the time to buy.This card, along with the RX 580, show superb performance for their price range.

## Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ Limited Edition Graphics Card

The [Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZGXTTK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06ZZGXTTK&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=010da69d2fcbb9314f7c9e4e0df9a94f) is a great choice for anyone looking to mine Zcash. 

The AMD 500 series are popular among miners, as they are cheaper, and easyier to set up. Furthermore, they pack quite a punch when it comes to mining. 

This GPU only draws 150 watts at max load, which makes it decently efficient, considering its top speed of 29 MH/s.

This card doesn't come perfectly equipped for miners straight out of the box, though with some slight tweaks, it is well suited for mining Zcash.

## NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition

Surprisingly, the [GeForce GTX 1070 founders edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GLRX81I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01GLRX81I&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=d10aa5bb4f5fef3b27134a488387dd4b) boasts excellent performance for its price, especially when optimized for mining. 

Using [NiceHashMiner](https://www.nicehash.com/) the 1070 has the power to mine at 31 MH/s, while only consuming 180 watts at max load. 

When you buy the GTX 1070  FE, not only are you getting an excellent mining tool, you are saving money on electricity as well.

This card is by far the best zcash miner due to its incredible price to performance ratio. 

After a few tweaks to best suit mining, this card is powerful and efficient. I would highly recommend this card to anyone looking to mine zcash. 

Many may assume that AMD cards are the only option for miners. This is simply not true.

## Setting Up Passive Income with Zcash Mining 

Mining Zcash is a great way to set up [passive income](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp). 

Look at it this way: 

When you go to work, you get paid for the hours you put in. If you work for a few hours, you'll be paid for a few hours. 

However, with Zcash mining, if you put in a few hours of work, you'll be paid indefinitely after that, even after you've stopped working. 

How does this work? 

That's the beauty of passive income. Once you set up your mining rig, you'll generate revenue all of the time, as long as you keep it on.

## Is Zcash Mining Practical? 

The answer is yes, as long as you invest in one of the GPUs listed above. Mining is a delicate balance of hashing power, the initial startup cost, and the cost of electricity. 

This is how you determine your return on investment. 

You want a GPU that isn't terribly expensive, but has enough hashing power to make the electricity bill worth it. All three of the above GPUs will give you an excellent return on investment.
