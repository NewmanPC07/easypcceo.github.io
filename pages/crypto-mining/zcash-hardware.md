Zcash uses equihash as its mining algorithm. Due to this, much like ethereum, the development of ASIC graphics cards for this cryptocurrency is unfeasible. 

The Claymore miner has a good long-standing reputation. In addition, it is only compatible with AMD graphics cards. 

That being said, here are the top 3 best graphics cards for Zcash miners:
