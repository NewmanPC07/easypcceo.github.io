Zcash uses equihash as its mining algorithm. Due to this, much like ethereum, the development of ASIC graphics cards for this cryptocurrency is unfeasible. 

The Claymore miner has a good long-standing reputation. In addition, it is only compatible with AMD graphics cards. 

That being said, here are the top 3 best graphics cards for Zcash miners:

The Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ is a great choice for anyone looking to mine Zcash. 

The AMD 500 series are popular among miners, as they are cheaper, and easyier to set up. Furthermore, they pack quite a punch when it comes to mining. 

This GPU only draws 150 watts at max load, which makes it decently efficient, considering its top speed of 29 MH/s.

Benchmark results: 

– Decred (DCR): 1.220 GHS
– CryptoNight (XMR): 600 H/s
– LBRY (LBC): 0.165 GHS
– Pascal (PASC): 0.830 GHS
– X11Ghost (SIB): 8.2 MHS

This card doesn't come perfectly equipped for miners straight out of the box, though with some slight tweaks, it is well suited for mining Zcash.
