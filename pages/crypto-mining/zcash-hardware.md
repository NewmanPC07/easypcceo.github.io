The Claymore miner has a good long-standing reputation. In addition, it is only compatible with AMD graphics cards. 

That being said, here are the top 3 best graphics cards for Zcash miners:

### 3. [Sapphire Radeon RX 480](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAEFAHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01NAEFAHC&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=6237ff99f7e40f32ccc8ecd04c4f515b">Sapphire Radeon NITRO Rx 480 4GB GDDR5 Dual HDMI / DVI-D / Dual DP OC w/ backplate (UEFI) PCI-E Graphics Card 11260-13-20G</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cryptocurrency06-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01NAEFAHC)

The Sapphire Radeon RX 480 is a card that should never be overloooked.

The RX 480, after a few tweaks, can easily generate 27 MH/s. It only draws 150 watts at max load, making it an efficient and powerful choice for miners.

### 2. [Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ Limited Edition Graphics Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZGXTTK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06ZZGXTTK&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=010da69d2fcbb9314f7c9e4e0df9a94f)

![RX 580](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/rx-580-nitro.jpg "RX 580 NITRO")

The Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ is a great choice for anyone looking to mine Zcash. 

The AMD 500 series are popular among miners, as they are cheaper, and easyier to set up. Furthermore, they pack quite a punch when it comes to mining. 

This GPU only draws 150 watts at max load, which makes it decently efficient, considering its top speed of 29 MH/s.

Benchmark results: 

– Decred (DCR): 1.220 GHS
– CryptoNight (XMR): 600 H/s
– LBRY (LBC): 0.165 GHS
– Pascal (PASC): 0.830 GHS
– X11Ghost (SIB): 8.2 MHS

This card doesn't come perfectly equipped for miners straight out of the box, though with some slight tweaks, it is well suited for mining Zcash.
