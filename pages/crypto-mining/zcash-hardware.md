[Zcash](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/how-to-mine-zcash/) uses equihash as its mining algorithm. Due to this, much like ethereum, the development of [ASIC](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ASIC-application-specific-integrated-circuit) graphics cards for this cryptocurrency is unfeasible. 

Zcash is based on a [decentralized blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain), much like [bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/). However, with bitcoin, if you know the adress, you can track how much money is being moved, and where it's going. With Zcash, all of that information is encrypted, rendering it impossible to track. 

## Zcash Mining Profitability 

When investing money, whether it's in a company, a product, or cryptocurrency, the investor must know that they'll see a profitable return on their money. 

Mining for cryptocurrency uses electricity. If you are mining 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, you definitely have a high potential to use a lot of electricity. 

This means it is important to calculate your profitability before investing in a mining setup. 

The value of Zcash is on the rise, but you can check your estimated profitability with this [profitability calculator.](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/zec?HashingPower=200&HashingUnit=H%2Fs&PowerConsumption=200&CostPerkWh=0.12)

## Top 3 Zcash Mining GPUs and ASICs 

### [Sapphire Radeon RX 480](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAEFAHC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01NAEFAHC&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=6237ff99f7e40f32ccc8ecd04c4f515b)

 The Sapphire Radeon RX 480 is a card that should never be overloooked. One would be wrong to dismiss the AMD RX 400 series graphics cards, as they are a powerful tool in a miner's tool belt.

Much to the dismay of the modern day gamer, AMD graphics cards are amazing at mining for Zcash. 

The RX 480, after a few tweaks, can easily generate 27 MH/s. It only draws 150 watts at max load, making it an efficient and powerful choice for miners. 

Due to the effectiveness of this card, it is out of stock quite often. Now is the time to buy.This card, along with the RX 580, show superb performance for their price range.

### [Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ Limited Edition Graphics Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZGXTTK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B06ZZGXTTK&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=010da69d2fcbb9314f7c9e4e0df9a94f)

![RX 580](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/rx-580-nitro.jpg "RX 580 NITRO")

The Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ is a great choice for anyone looking to mine Zcash. 

The AMD 500 series are popular among miners, as they are cheaper, and easyier to set up. Furthermore, they pack quite a punch when it comes to mining. 

This GPU only draws 150 watts at max load, which makes it decently efficient, considering its top speed of 29 MH/s.

This card doesn't come perfectly equipped for miners straight out of the box, though with some slight tweaks, it is well suited for mining Zcash.

### [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Founders Edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GLRX81I/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01GLRX81I&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=d10aa5bb4f5fef3b27134a488387dd4b)

![GTX 1070 FE](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/gtx1070.png "GTX 1070")

Surprisingly, the GeForce GTX 1070 founders edition boasts excellent performance for its price, especially when optimized for mining. 

Using [NiceHashMiner](https://www.nicehash.com/) the 1070 has the power to mine at 31 MH/s, while only consuming 180 watts at max load. 

When you buy the GTX 1070  FE, not only are you getting an excellent mining tool, you are saving money on electricity as well.

![1070 FE Specs](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/1070-specs.jpg "1070 FE SPECS") 

This card is by far the best zcash miner due to its incredible price to performance ratio. 

After a few tweaks to best suit mining, this card is powerful and efficient. I would highly recommend this card to anyone looking to mine zcash. 

Many may assume that AMD cards are the only option for miners. This is simply not true.
