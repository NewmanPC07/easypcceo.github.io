## What is Bitcoin? 
<img alt="Bitcoin Logo" class="img-right img-small" src="/img/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-logo.png" />


A Bitcoin is one unit of digital currency. It is considered a decentralized currency because it is not controlled by one person, bank, credit card company, or government.  

Instead of a central authority like a bank or a credit card company, the community is in control of Bitcoin.

Each transaction is recorded in a public network called the blockchain. Miners verify these transactions with their Bitcoin mining hardware. 

Bitcoins are transferred directly person to person, which minimizes fees that are associated with most banks and credit card companies. 

## Bitcoin Mining Hardware

When Bitcoin was first invented, the CPU was used to mine. Quickly miners discovered that the GPU is far more effective. The prices of GPUs across the market skyrocketed as miners bought up all of the GPUs they could get their hands on. 

Eventually, an ASIC was invented specifically for efficiently mining Bitcoins.

Nowadays, the only way to mine Bitcoin is with [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit){:target="_blank"}s.

## Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable? 

Profitable Bitcoin mining is next to impossible for the average person. 

Here's why:

Most Bitcoin mining is performed in China where electricity costs are low compared to the United States. Big companies own thousands of ASICs housed in a warehouse, all mining 24/7. 

This makes it very difficult for the average person to turn a big profit by mining. 

If you're looking to make money, we recommend you mine [other altcoins](/crypto-mining/). They're *far* more profitable, and they can be exchanged for Bitcoin on exchanges like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=16557105){:target="_blank"}. 

On the other hand, Bitcoin mining can be quite fun if you're a hobbyist, not to mention it helps the Bitcoin community. 

For those just looking to obtain Bitcoin, it might be easier to buy it from an exchange like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b){:target="_blank"}. 

## ASICs' Impact on Decentralization 

ASICs are specifically developed for mining. They offer insanely high hashing power with low electricity consumption in comparison. 

They seem great at first glance, but they're actually not good for a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Why?

Well, instead of the entire Bitcoin community mining (and verifying the network) in a decentralized fashion, most of the mining tends to occur in one place. 

Let me explain: 

Evidently, the most powerful ASIC hardware can be extremely expensive. That being said, not everyone can afford to get their hands on one. 

Even if they can, they probably won't turn a profit unless they can afford many ASICs. 

These days, most Bitcoin mining is performed in China. Electricity is cheap there, and wealthy investors capitalize on it. 

They buy hundreds (if not thousands) of miners and house them in a large warehouse specifically designed for mining. They run all of the miners at one time. The insane hashing power combined with low electricity costs results in vast profit. 

Unfortunately for the average Joe, they can't turn a profit on their own. This leads to a centralization of mining power in one place, owned by one entity rather than many people all mining together. 

Newer altcoins like [Litecoin](/crypto-mining/litecoin-hardware/) tried to change their algorithm to be ASIC resistant, using a new algorithm called [Scrypt](/crypto-mining/scrypt-hardware/). 

It was resistant for a while, but soon Litecoin fell victim to ASICs as well. Other altcoins like [Vertcoin](/crypto-mining/vertcoin-hardware/) and [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) use special algorithms that are ASIC resistant in order to prevent centralization. 

## Can You Still Make Money on Your Own?

*Yes*, yes you can. 

You'll have to join something called a [Bitcoin mining pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool). This is a network of miners that all work together to solve a common problem. 

All of you would use your hashing power to verify a block. Once the block is verified, the block reward is distributed evenly based on how much each person contributed. This is the best way for individual miners to generate a profit, as it greatly increases your odds of solving Bitcoin's ever more complicated algorithm. 

## Bitcoin Mining Pools to Consider 

As mentioned above, Bitcoin mining pools are your best bet to turn a profit. 

Here are some mining pools to consider: 

* [Antpool](https://antpool.com/)
* [BTC China](https://pool.btcc.com/)
* [BitFury](http://bitfury.com/)

Happy mining!
