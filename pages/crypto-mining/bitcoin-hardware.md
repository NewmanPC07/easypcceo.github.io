## What is Bitcoin? 

A bitcoin is one unit of digital currency. It is considered a decentralized currency. 

Instead of a central authority like a bank or a government, the community is in control of Bitcoin.

Each transaction is recorded in a public network called the blockchain. Miners verify these transactions. 

Bitcoions are transferred directly person to person, which minimizes fees that are associated with most banks and credit card company.
