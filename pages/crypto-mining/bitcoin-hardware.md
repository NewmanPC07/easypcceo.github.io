## What is Bitcoin? 

A bitcoin is one unit of digital currency. It is considered a decentralized currency. 

Instead of a central authority like a bank or a credit card company, the community is in control of Bitcoin.

Each transaction is recorded in a public network called the blockchain. Miners verify these transactions. 

Bitcoins are transferred directly person to person, which minimizes fees that are associated with most banks and credit card company. 

## Is Bitcoin Mining Profitable? 

Profitable Bitcoin mining is next to impossible for the average person. 

However, if you have the best mining hardware, it is still profitable, and can even be fun. 

 NOTE: Bitcoin mining is competitive, and can be hard for the average person to get started with. If you just want to obtain Bitcoin, it may be a better idea to [buy Bitcoin.](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5967ac4be42b2d0260de144b) 

## Bitcoin Mining Hardware

When Bitcoin was first invented, the CPU was used to mine. Quickly miners discovered that the GPU is far more effective. Quickly, the prices of GPUs across the market skyrocketed as miners bought up all of the GPUs they could get their hands on. 

Eventually, an ASIC was invented specifically for efficiently mining Bitcoins.

Nowadays, the only way to mine Bitcoin is with [ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)s. 

Below are the top 5 best Bitcoin mining ASICs:

## Antminer S5

This miner, though expensive, has a hash rate of 14 TH/s. It has incredibly high processing power. 

This ASIC draws 1350 W from the wall, and it is recommended that the [Antminer APW-12 1600 Watt Bitcoin Miner PSU](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338145148&customid=&icep_uq=apw-12+power+supply&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) be used, as the Antminer S9 does NOT include a power supply. 

Though this miner is quite powerful, it is very unlikely that one unit will successfully mine a bitcoin in a short amount of time. We recommend getting involved in a [Bitcoin mining pool.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_pools)

The Antminer S9 is an expensive ASIC, but it's worth every penny. Not only is it one of the most powerful miners on the market, it is also energy efficient. It only uses .1 Joules per Gigahash. It is over 2 times as efficient as the Antminer S7.
