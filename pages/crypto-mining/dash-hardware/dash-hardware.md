ASIC cards (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) are used to mine Dash.

They are designed specifically for mining – this means they're both more expensive and more powerful. 

What does this mean for your GPU?

Well, even if you have a powerful GPU like the [GTX 1080](/crypto-mining/gtx-1080-review/), you should stick to Dash mining ASICs.

In this guide, we're going to be talking about Dash mining, and whether or not it's profitable in 2019.

<h2>Antminer D3</h2>
<h3>Dash ASIC Miner</h3>
<p>The Antminer D3 is, by far, the best Dash miner on the market. With a hashrate of 19.3 GH/s, this miner draws 1200 watts from the wall. You just can't beat this ASIC's hashing power! While the power consumption might seem a bit high, the hashing power of this miner makes up for it.</p>

## ASIC Mining in 2019 

ASICs are expensive, and when a new model is released, there is a significant impact on the coins and algorithms they mine. 

Shortly after release, they cause mining difficulty to skyrocket. Even an ultra-powerful ASIC will only last a short while before the mining algorithm's difficulty catches up. 

ASICs drive the cost of mining up, making it harder for the average person to join in. Only large mining companies can afford to mine at scale are profitable, mainly because they have the capital to invest in many ASICs and they mine in locations with cheap electricity. 

Mining cryptocurrency – including Dash – is difficult in 2019 if you wish to turn a profit. 

## Is Dash Mining Profitable? 

Mining is an expensive investment in 2019, probably too much for the average person. 

Due to the rising block difficulty of [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/) and other tokens (like Dash), it's only getting harder to mine profitably. 

![dash mining profitability calculator](/img/cryptocurrency/dash/profit-calculator.jpg)

Combined with the low value of Dash and other tokens (compared to their price at the end of 2017), it's harder than ever before.

Tokens like [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum/), [Monero](/crypto-mining/monero/), [Litecoin](/crypto-mining/litecoin/), and more have taken a profitability hit in the past year. 

On the other hand, the cryptocurrency market is beginning to rally. 

It seems like the bulls are back – assuming the market rises once again, mining will become more profitable. 

If you have an efficient Dash miner, the value of Dash is on the rise, and you have access to cheap electricity, Dash mining may be profitable for you. 

It's always best to use a mining calculator to see what your ROI looks like. 

## Dash Mining Calculator 

There are many popular mining profitability calculators out there, and they all pretty much do the same thing. 

You can use [this mining calculator from CryptoCompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/dash?HashingPower=19.3&HashingUnit=GH%2Fs&PowerConsumption=1200&CostPerkWh=0.10&MiningPoolFee=1){: target="_blank"} to test your mining profitability with the Antminer D3. 

It takes into account your hashrate, power usage, mining pool fees, and the current price of Dash when calculating profitability. 

## Dash in a Nutshell

## Dash Mining Pools 

Joining a Dash pool will help to ensure more consistent success. Instead of just you mining on your own, you can team up with other people also looking to mine Dash. This makes the process of mining much quicker. 

The official dash website recommends these mining pools: 

* [Supernova](https://dash.suprnova.cc/){:target="_blank"}
* [CoinMine](https://www2.coinmine.pl/dash/){:target="_blank"}
* [zpool](http://www.zpool.ca/){:target="_blank"}
* [MinerGate](https://minergate.com/){:target="_blank"}

If you decide to go this route, it is crucial to stay on top of the latest mining pool updates.  

Here's why: 

You don't want to mine for a pool that suddenly increases its fees. Moreover, you don't want to mine for a pool that no longer exists. 

## Dash Cloud Mining 

Cloud mining is different from traditional mining - instead of having to buy your own mining hardware, you can hire another company to do the mining for you. In exchange, you'll receive a portion of the cryptocurrency they mine. 

[Nice Hash](https://www.nicehash.com/cloud-mining/dash){: target="_blank"} has a pretty popular cloud mining service you can check out. 

## X11 Dash Mining 

Dash uses the [X11 algorithm](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/pros-cons-x11-algorithm/){:target="_blank"}, which is becoming more popular every day. This algorithm is secure, effective, and has a relatively low power cost. 

The best part about the X11 algorithm is its purpose: everything Bitcoin was intended to be. It decentralizes hashing power by making it easier to mine. 

This means the average person looking to mine cryptocurrency can mine this coin without breaking the bank. 

Providing insanely fast hashes, it is a profitable algorithm to mine. Unfortunately, it lacks the community that bitcoin has, but that is changing as more and more people begin to mine cryptocurrencies with the X11 algorithm. 

All in all, the X11 algorithm is very effective and a good choice to mine. 

## Transparency of Dash 

Coinbase is a fully regulated entity, subject to all of the laws of the United States. If the government went after Coinbase, they could see all of the activities made by that site. 

With Dash, as a digital cash alternative, you can get the transaction data, but you can't follow it through its history. This maintains the users' privacy. This is one of the major differences between Dash and Bitcoin. 

Evan Duffield of Dash makes this comparison: 

<blockquote><p>
Three people are sitting at a table. Each person takes out their wallet. Each wallet has two 10 dollar bills. All three people set their two 10 dollar bills on the table, and they all turn around. A fourth guy comes around, and mixes up all of the 10 dollar bills. Then, everyone turns around and takes two ten dollar bills back. What allows this to happen is something called the [Master Node.](http://dashmasternode.org/what-is-a-masternode/){: target="_blank"}</p></blockquote>

## Fungibility of Dash 

Fungibility is an idea in which any token on the network is interchangable with any other token on the network. 

Dash incorporates this idea, as each coin is worth the same as any other coin on the network. Moreover, the coins are interchangable. 

Other types of coins like Bitcoin that are on a public ledger can be more easily traced. 

If, for example, you bought coins online, and they were previously used on the Silk Road, the government can come and take them from you because they were involved in illegal activity. Keep in mind, however, that this is highly unlikely and as of today, Bitcoin is a sound investment. 

Dash eliminates this because each coin is just as valuable as the rest. This eliminates the possiblity of the coins being traced. 

## Conclusion: Is Dash Mining Worth It?  

If you're interested in mining Dash to turn a profit, you're probably better off buying it from an exchange instead.

Mining for a profit is hard right now, and buying an ASIC is a pretty big investment.

On the other hand, if you want to mine as a hobby, Dash is a great way to get started. Dash mining is pretty easy once you've got the hardware setup as well. 

At the end of the day, it really depends on what your goals are. Most people aren't going to get rich from Dash mining, so keep that in mind before you buy! 

Oh, and make sure to use a mining profitability calculator before you buy.
