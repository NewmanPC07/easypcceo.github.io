## What is Ethereum? 

Ethereum is distributed among a [public blockchain](https://distributed.com/news/what-is-the-blockchain/), much like [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware/). 

Ethereum is a completely different blockchain protocol than Bitcoin. Bitcoin's blockchain is based on proof of work. Ethereum's blockchain, although currently is based on proof of work, is soon to become based on [proof of stake](http://www.investopedia.com/news/ethereum-adopt-proofofstake/).

There are real figure heads who run Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, which is owned by nobody. Ethereum also features decentralized apps. The Ethereum blockchain is the base, and other people can build decentralized blockchains on top of Ethereum. 

Unlike Bitcoin, in the Ethereum blockchain, miners obtain Ether, the crypto token behind the network.  Ethereum's blockchain is its own currency. 

In summary, Ethereum is a new blockchain seperate from Bitcoin with co-founders around the world. It has a different cryptocurrency which is Ether. It can be built upon using a decentralized blockchain. Above all, coming soon, Ethereum will move to proof of stake. 

## Ethereum Mining Hardware 

In order to mine Ethereum, you need a powerful [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (Graphics Processing Unit). Originally, the CPU was used for mining, but miners quickly discovered the GPU was far more efficient and effective for mining. 

Finding the right GPU for mining Ethereum can be difficult. It is important to balance the power of the GPU with the cost of the GPU and the cost of electricity. 

As we have seen with other popular cryptocurrencies such as [Zcash](/crypto-mining/zcash-hardware/), [Dash](/crypto-mining/dash-hardware/), [Litecoin](/crypto-mining/litecoin-hardware/), and [Bitcoin](/crypto-mining/bitcoin-hardware), mining profitability is always directly related with these factors. 

Here are the 3 best Ethereum mining GPUs in 2017: 

### Radeon R9 295X2

By far the most powerful Ethereum miner, the [Radeon R9 295X2](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338114702&customid=&icep_uq=Radeon+R9+295X2&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) has a hash rate of 46 MH/s, drawing 500 W from the wall. This means you'll see a yearly return of $754.44 annually per card.
