The value of dash is on the rise, and the time is now to get in on the action. 

Unlike [Zcash](/crypto-mining/zcash-hardware/) and [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) ASIC cards can be used to mine Dash. 

These cards are the fastest and most power efficient solution to mining cryptocurrency. 

Here are 3 of the best Dash mining ASICs and GPUs:  

## [Baikal Mini ASIC Miner](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338112809&customid=dash-miners&icep_uq=baikal+mini+miner&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)

The Baikal Mini [ASIC](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ASIC-application-specific-integrated-circuit) miner is easily one of the most efficient ASIC miners on the market today. 

It is only 135mm(L) x 135mm(W) x 108mm(H). That being said, it is obviously extremely small. How does it fair in terms of Hash rate and power consumption?

Consuming only 75 watts at max load, this miner has a hash rate of 300MH/s. 

Considering it only uses 75 watts, it is obvious to see why this is a great miner.

## [Baikal Giant A900 ASIC Miner](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338112809&customid=dash-miners&icep_uq=baikal+giant+a900+miner&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)

This ASIC features extremely low power consumption of 216 W from the wall with a hash rate of 900 MH/s.

This means that you'll get a great return on your investment for the hardware, especially considering the value of Dash is going up. [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) estimates an income of about $700 USD per month with this card. 

![Baikal Giant A900](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/baikal-giant-a900.jpg "Baikal Giant A900"){: .img-medium .img-right}

This miner is especially good for beginners, as it is simple and easy to optimize. Unfortunately it does not ship with a power supply, but you can buy any ATX power supply with the appropriate wattage and it will get the job done.

This is a multi-algorithm ASIC miner, which means it can mine X11/X13/X14/X15/Quark/Qubit. However, Dash is the easily the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine with this ASIC, as it reaches 900 MH/s. It only uses 217 W at max load. 

With the Baikal Giant-A900 miner, you'll see a weekly return of $87.53 USD and a monthly return of $375.13 USD per miner. With returns of $4,500 USD annually per miner, this is a sound investment. If you invest in more than one miner, your profits will be even greater.

## [iBelink DM11G Dash X11 ASIC Miners](http://bitbaza.com/shop/25/desc/ibelinkdm11g)

NOTE: The above website is in russian. The Google Translate extension can be added to chrome. This will allow you to translate the page to English.
It is easy to setup. Simply connect a power cable and an ethernet cable to begin mining. 

This miner has a hash rate of 10,800 MH/s, while only consuming 810 W at the wall. Considering the hash rate of this miner, it is evident the true value of this ASIC. This miner can be used in large scale mining farms, or at home. 

This is the world's fastest and most efficient Dash miner. It's price to performance ratio is astronomically high. Unfortunately, as it is very popular and relatively new, it is hard to find it in stock. All the more reason to get your hands on it as soon as possible.

## Non-ASIC Mining Hardware 

Though ASIC miners are powerful and efficient, not everybody wants to spend the money for them, as they can be quite expensive. Furthermore, other graphics cards can still mine Dash and other cryptocurrencies quite efficiently.
