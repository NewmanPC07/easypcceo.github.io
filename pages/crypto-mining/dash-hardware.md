The value of dash is on the rise, and the time is now to get in on the action. Dash mining in 2017 is extremely profitable. 

Unlike [Zcash](/crypto-mining/zcash-hardware/) and [Ethereum](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) ASIC cards can be used to mine Dash. 

These cards are the fastest and most power efficient solution to mining cryptocurrency. 

## Dash Mining Hardware

### [Baikal Mini ASIC Miner](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338112809&customid=dash-miners&icep_uq=baikal+mini+miner&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)

The Baikal Mini [ASIC](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ASIC-application-specific-integrated-circuit) miner is easily one of the most efficient ASIC miners on the market today. 

It is only 135mm(L) x 135mm(W) x 108mm(H). That being said, it is obviously extremely small. How does it fair in terms of Hash rate and power consumption?

Consuming only 75 watts at max load, this miner has a hash rate of 300MH/s. 

Considering it only uses 75 watts, it is obvious to see why this is a great miner.

### [Baikal Giant A900 ASIC Miner](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338112809&customid=dash-miners&icep_uq=baikal+giant+a900+miner&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)

This ASIC features extremely low power consumption of 216 W from the wall with a hash rate of 900 MH/s.

This means that you'll get a great return on your investment for the hardware, especially considering the value of Dash is going up. [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) estimates an income of about $700 USD per month with this card. 

![Baikal Giant A900](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/baikal-giant-a900.jpg "Baikal Giant A900"){: .img-small .img-right}

This miner is especially good for beginners, as it is simple and easy to optimize. Unfortunately it does not ship with a power supply, but you can buy any ATX power supply with the appropriate wattage and it will get the job done. 

![Giant A900 Specs](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/giant-a900-specs.png "Giant A900 Specs")

This is a multi-algorithm ASIC miner, which means it can mine X11/X13/X14/X15/Quark/Qubit. However, Dash is the easily the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine with this ASIC, as it reaches 900 MH/s. It only uses 217 W at max load. 

With the Baikal Giant-A900 miner, you'll see a weekly return of $87.53 USD and a monthly return of $375.13 USD per miner. With returns of $4,500 USD annually per miner, this is a sound investment. If you invest in more than one miner, your profits will be even greater.

### [iBelink DM11G Dash X11 ASIC Miners](http://bitbaza.com/shop/25/desc/ibelinkdm11g)

NOTE: The above website is in russian. The Google Translate extension can be added to chrome. This will allow you to translate the page to English.
It is easy to setup. Simply connect a power cable and an ethernet cable to begin mining. 

![DM11G](/img/cryptocurrency/gpu/dm11g.jpg "iBelink DM11G"){: .img-medium-large}

This miner has a hash rate of 10,800 MH/s, while only consuming 810 W at the wall. Considering the hash rate of this miner, the true value of it is evident. This miner can be used in large scale mining farms, or at home. 

This is the world's fastest and most efficient Dash miner. Its price to performance ratio is astronomically high. Unfortunately, as it is very popular and relatively new, it is hard to find it in stock. All the more reason to get your hands on it as soon as possible. 

Anyone who is serious about mining Dash for a profit should purchase this ASIC.

## Non-ASIC Mining Hardware 

Though ASIC miners are powerful and efficient, not everybody wants to spend the money for them, as they can be quite expensive. Furthermore, other graphics cards can still mine Dash and other cryptocurrencies quite efficiently. 

You can find other X11 mining cards below: 

* [XFX 7990 (21.8 Mh/s for X11)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HGLNOHW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00HGLNOHW&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=d63949615ea948e49a2b3bd223d34998)
* [SAPPHIRE R9 Nano (20 Mh/s for X11)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015121DMA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B015121DMA&linkCode=as2&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&linkId=353099044be8d6cf91a42e810e5ba223)

## Dash Mining Pools 

Joining a Dash pool will help to ensure more consistent success. Instead of just you mining on your own, you can team up with other people also looking to mine Dash. This makes the process of mining much quicker. 

The official dash website recommends these mining pools: 

* [Supernova](https://dash.suprnova.cc/)
* [CoinMine](https://www2.coinmine.pl/dash/)
* [zpool](http://www.zpool.ca/)
* [MinerGate](https://minergate.com/)

If you decide to go this route, it is crucial to stay on top of the latest mining pool updates.  

Here's why: 

You don't want to mine for a pool that suddenly increases its fees. Moreover, you don't want to mine for a pool that no longer exists. 

## X11 Dash Mining 

Dash uses the [X11 algorithm](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/pros-cons-x11-algorithm/), which is becoming more popular every day. This algorithm is secure, effective, and has a relatively low power cost. 

The best part about the X11 algorithm is its purpose. It is everything Bitcoin was intended to be. Decentralizing hashing power by making it easier to mine. 

This means the average person looking to mine cryptocurrency can mine this coin without breaking the bank. 

Providing insanely fast hashes, it is a profitable algorithm to mine. Unfortunately, it lacks the community that bitcoin has, but that is changing as more and more people begin to mine cryptocurrencies with the X11 algorithm. 

All in all, the X11 algorithm is very effective and a good choice to mine. 

## Transparency of Dash 

Coinbase is a fully regulated entity, subject to all of the laws of the United States. If the government went after Coinbase, they could see all of the activities made by that site. 

With Dash, as a digital cash alternative, you can get the transaction data, but you can't follow it through its history. This maintains the users' privacy. This is one of the major differences between Dash and Bitcoin. 

Evan Duffield of Dash makes this comparison: 

Three people are sitting at a table. Each person takes out their wallet. Each wallet has two 10 dollar bills. All three people set their two 10 dollar bills on the table, and they all turn around. A fourth guy comes around, and mixes up all of the 10 dollar bills. Then, everyone turns around and takes two ten dollar bills back. What allows this to happen is something called the [Master Node.](http://dashmasternode.org/what-is-a-masternode/) 

## Fungibility of Dash 

Fungibility is an idea in which any token on the network is interchangable with any other token on the network. 

Dash incorporates this idea, as each coin is worth the same as any other coin on the network. Moreover, the coins are interchangable. 

Other types of coins like Bitcoin that are on a public ledger can be more easily traced. 

If, for example, you bought coins online, and they were previously used on the Silk Road, the government can come and take them from you because they were involved in illegal activity. Keep in mind, however, that this is highly unlikely and as of today, Bitcoin is a sound investment. 

Dash eliminates this because each coin is just as valuable as the rest. This eliminates the possiblity of the coins being traced.
