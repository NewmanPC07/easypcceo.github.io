Thanks for confirming your subscription. 

Here's what you should expect: 

Over the next few days, I'll be sending you a few emails teaching you how to buy gaming PC components on the low... I'm talking 1/5 of the retail price. 

That's right - you're going to learn how I built my first gaming PC for $200, with an Intel i7 and a GTX 1080 Ti. 

You'll be able to use the same tips when building your next rig to get some insane deals!

After you've learned how to get the best bang for your PC gaming buck, I'll send over a weekly email to share more cool stuff with you. 

I'm going to keep you up to date with the latest hardware news, insane deals and flash sales, tips, tricks, and more. 

I promise to never spam your inbox like other email marketers do. Every email I send you will be packed full of value, that's for sure. 

And you can unsubscribe at any time - it won't hurt my feelings!

That being said, check your inbox because the first money saving tip is probably there :)
