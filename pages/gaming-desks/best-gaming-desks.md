## The Importance of a Sweet Gaming Desk 

Having the right desk for you completes your PC gaming setup. Sure you could use any old desk, but it wouldn't asthetically fit your setup. Furthermore, it probably wouldn't be too ergonomic either. 

Let's face it:

All gamers occasionally lock themselves in their room with a two liter of Mountain Dew and a bag of Doritos for hours on end playing their favorite game with their friends. Don't be ashamed, we've all been there. 

While it's a great pass time, hours on end of sitting in front of a screen can grow quite uncomfortable. Having the proper desk for you can drastically reduce if not eliminate this issue. 

Furthermore, having a sweet gaming desk completes your setup. Think about it: you invest so much in an amazing PC with cool case fans and LEDs, a mouse/mousepad and keyboard, headset, monitor, etc. Why should you settle for a sub-par gaming desk? 

![Atlantic](/img/desk/atlantic.jpeg)

From a health standpoint, having the right desk is also important. If your desk isn't the right height for you, it will affect your posture and more than likely cause [back pain.](http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20355520,00.html) 

Lastly, you'll need enough space for all of your peripherals. As a PC gamer, you need room for monitor(s), keyboard, mouse and mousepad, your [gaming chair](/best-gaming-chairs/), etc. Ideally you'd want your PC on the desk as well. 

It's not smart to store your PC on the floor, especially carpet flooring, as it'll easily collect dust which obstructs airflow. In addition, carpet suffocates the PSU fan if your PSU is mounted on the bottom of your case. 

Buying the proper desk for you and your gaming setup is crucial. This guide will help you find the right one for you. 

## Finding the Right Desk for You 

Selecting the proper desk for your setup shouldn't be difficult. Simply figure out your criteria, and go from there. **Here are some things to consider:**

### Size 

Knowing the right size for you is critical. Not only the surface area of the desk, but the height of it as well.   

You have a monitor if not two or three, a keyboard and mouse, a PC, and you'll probably want room for food or any other miscellaneous items. 

![ultimate](/img/desk/ultimate.jpg)

The last thing you want for your setup is clutter everywhere and a cramped setup. PC gaming is far superior to consoles. Having enough desk space will help ensure you receive the most out of your PC gaming experience. 

As mentioned previously, having a desk of the proper height is also important. Having a desk that is too high or low leads to bad posture which grows quite uncomfortable very quickly.

</div>

### Assembly 

Are you good at working with your hands? Or maybe you prefer a quick assembly? Both are factors to consider when buying a desk. Some desks require tools for their construction while others can quickly snap together without much hassle. 

### Material 

What your desk is made of will obviously have the largest impact on the look, feel, weight, and price of the desk. While many prefer a wood desk, their are other options out there. 

**Glass:** Glass desks are sleek, refined, and elegant. While they look awesome, they're super cool, they aren't as sturdy as steel or wood.  

**Wood:** You can't go wrong with a nice wooden desk. They look and feel spectacular, providing a traditional feel. Unfortunately, wooden desks tend to be a bit heavier than their alternatives. 

**Steel:** Steel desks are my personal favorite as they're leightweight yet sturdy. 

At the end of the day, all three materials are a great choice in their own way. It's really all up to you.

## Flash Furniture Glass Gaming Desk
![Flash Furniture Glass Desk](/img/desk/replace3.jpg){: .img-middle}


**2.** The [Flash Furniture glass gaming desk](http://amzn.to/2zzespR) is one of my favorites on this list for many reasons. 

It has a [contemporary design](http://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/contemporary-style-101) with a clear tempered glass surface. Not only does the tempered glass look nice, it's strong, too. The desk also features a sliding keyboard tray, perfect for a PC gamer. 

It also has beveled fornt legs, a cherry laminate finish and a privacy panel. For just $90, you can't go wrong with this desk. You can find it on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2zzespR) in 8 different colors/styles.

## Walker Edison Soreno 3-Piece Corner Gaming Desk
![Walker Edison Soreno 3-Piece Corner Gaming Desk](/img/desk/replace2.jpg){: .img-middle}

**3.** The [Walker Edison Soreno 3-Piece Corner Gaming Desk](http://amzn.to/2x6D7Ak) is a favorite among gamers. This is due to its "L-shape". The Walker Edison has a space in the bottom middle of the desk specifically for your PC. 

It features tempered glass, a black steel frame, and a black finish. It's sturdy, and feels as good as it looks. 

This desk is among the most versatile in this top list. Comparitively to the Flash Furniture desk, it features a sliding keyboard tray which can be mounted on either side. If we could recommend one desk out of the three in the budget range, this would be it.

## Atlantic Gaming Desk
![Atlantic Gaming Desk](/img/desk/atlantic-gaming-desk.png){: .img-middle}


**4.** The [Atlantic Gaming Desk](http://amzn.to/2x7ZMMF) was designed specifically with PC gamers in mind! It's an excellent choice for those with a single monitor setup. However, it may not be the BEST pick if you are rocking two or more monitors. 

This is for two reasons. First and foremost, it doesn't have as much surface area as some of the other desks on this list. That being said, it's a great choice if you're in a small space. 

Second, it has a monitor stand in the middle of the desk. While this is nice for one monitor, it isn't ideal for two. Luckily, you can pretty easily remove it to fit two 27" monitors on it. 

Aside from that, the desk is solid. It has a great cable management system, and non-marring feet. It features a steel-rod construction, a charging station, speaker trays, a storage drawer, a table-top reinforcement bar, a monitor stand, two controller hooks, a game storage rack, a rear power-strip holder, a headphone hook and a cup holder. 

It's safe to say this is a true gaming desk, deservant of a true PC gamer. Coming in at around $120, this desk has rightfully earned its place on our top 7 list.

The top of the desk is made of clear 6/5mm tempered glass, and also has a display shelf and a slide-out keyboard tray. **This desk requires home assembly**.

I use this desk in my setup, and I must say, I absolutely love it. I haven't had any problems or complaints. It's the perfect height and feel for me, and provides plenty of room for my monitors, keyboard and mouse, etc.
