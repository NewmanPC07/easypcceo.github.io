Here's the deal: 

You're here because you want to build a PC case with a ton of hard drive storage space.

I was in your position the last time I wanted to upgrade my PC - I had too many games, and not enough storage.

There's not much good information on the web, mostly just forums and poorly written product pages in broken English. 

That's why I've compiled the ultimate list of the best PC cases for hard drive storage on the market in 2020. 

Let's dive in: 

## 5 Best PC Cases for Hard Drive Storage 

Here's a table of the top 5 best options on the market:

## All Around Best PC Case for Hard Drive Storage 

The Phanteks Enthoo Pro M TG ATX Mid Tower Case is an absolute monster of a case and has tons of modularity and support for builds of all types. 

This mid-range PC case is a terrific all around case for hard drive storage, if you're willing to spend a bit of extra money on the drive mounts. 

It supports up to eight 3.5" hard drive bays and up to three dedicated 2.5" drive bays. 

There is enough room for up to eight 3.5" bays to easily be added with simple mounting brackets, but those brackets do not come with the case and must be purchased separately.

However, two drive brackets at the top of the case, in addition to a single 2.5" bracket behind the motherboard tray come included. 

You'll notice there isn't a standard drive cage, allowing air to flow freely from the front of the case.

But this allows you to install drives with flexible mounting options in any of the five spots.

You can mount them on top or bottom and out of the way, or move them in the center so they're cooled by the fans. 

It's totally up to you, which is a nice feature.

The Pro M also features a tempered glass side panel window, not to mention plenty of room for radiators, graphics cards, CPU coolers, your power supply, etc.

It is a midtower case with support for E-ATX, ATX, Micro ATX and Mini ITX form factors. 

One thing I don't like about this case is how flimsy the side panels are.

Although the rest of the case's structure is quite sturdy, the panels have a bit more flex than I'd like on a case at this price point.

Still, the value for the money is pretty insane at this price point, and you'd be hard pressed to find a case that can offer more, for less. 

The I/O has two USB 3 ports, audio jacks and the reset button on the side, with the power button on the top.

Phantex has done a great job with wiring as well.

Behind the front panel there's a removable dust filter that covers the front intake.

However, you'll still have to perform periodic maintanence, as the side ventilation is behind the dust filter which will allow dust to enter the case. 

The top has a large magnetic filter as well that covers the entire ventilation area. 

The front of the case supports triple 120mm fans or dual 140mm with the mounting strips.

There's only a single 140mm fan included with this case, meaning you'll need to populate the case with your own fans.

On top of the case, Phanteks uses a removable bracket solution which is brilliant and makes installation far easier. 

All in all, this thing is pretty solid and you can't go wrong, especially if you want a case designed for custom hard drive storage.
