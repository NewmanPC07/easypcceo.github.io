Here's the deal: 

You're here because you want to build a PC case with a ton of hard drive storage space.

I was in your position the last time I wanted to upgrade my PC - I had too many games, and not enough storage.

There's not much good information on the web, mostly just forums and poorly written product pages in broken English. 

That's why I've compiled the ultimate list of the best PC cases for hard drive storage on the market in 2020. 

Let's dive in: 

## 5 Best PC Cases for Hard Drive Storage 

Here's a table of the top 5 best options on the market:

## All Around Best PC Case for Hard Drive Storage 

Phanteks Enthoo Pro M TG ATX Mid Tower Case

This mid-range PC case is a terrific all around case for hard drive storage. 

It supports up to eight 3.5" hard drive bays and up to three dedicated 2.5" drive bays.

The Pro M also features a tempered glass side panel window, not to mention plenty of room for radiators, graphics cards, CPU coolers, your power supply, etc.

It is a midtower case with support for E-ATX, ATX, Micro ATX and Mini ITX form factors. 

One thing I don't like about this case is how flimsy the side panels are. 

Although the rest of the case's structure is quite sturdy, the panels have a bit more flex than I'd like on a case at this price point.

Still, the value for the money is pretty insane at this price point, and you'd be hard pressed to find a case that can offer more, for less.
