## Should you Buy a 1440p Monitor? 

While 1080p monitors have 2073600 pixels, 1440p monitors have 3686400 pixels. That is a 78% increase. Furthermore, 1440p monitors have a significantly higher [pixel density](http://www.tested.com/tech/371-why-pixel-density-matters-more-than-just-screen-size-or-resolution/). If you want the full experience of your gaming rig, 1440p is the way to go. 

The fine details of the display will be crisper and easier to see. In fast paced competitve games, being able to pick out the little details can give you the edge you need to win. 

Moreover, game developers spend lots of time making their games look beautiful. The numbers say 1440p is 78% more beautiful than 1080p. It's time to make the switch.

## Construction of the Monitor

This monitor is supported by three wides legs and a circular stand finished with a grey color. The panel has a cool pattern on the rear, completing the futuristic look of the monitor. 

The base has LEDs that illuminate the ROG logo downwards onto your desk. You can alter the brightness of the light, or turn it off.

The monitor is among the largest on the market, rendering it a bit more difficult to set up than other monitors. 

## Controls

There are no buttons on the front of the PG348Q. Instead, the Power switch, a five-way toggle button, and two hot keys are located on the right-rear of the cabinet. 

One button is a GamePlus hotkey that launches a menu, allowing you to select one of four crosshair-aiming targets, set game timers, and enable a Frames-Per-Second (FPS) counter. The other key launches the Turbo Mode feature, where you can choose one of seven refresh rates, ranging from 60Hz to 100Hz.  

## Functionality/Image Quality of the Monitor 
![BenQ](/img/1440p-monitors/rog.jpg){: .img-middle}

[Trusted Reviews](http://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-republic-of-gamers-swift-pg348q-image-quality-screen-modes-uniformity-and-verdict-page-2) found the average Delta E of the monitor to be 1.74, just shy of the 2.0 barrier. They also found a color temperature of 6,366K, another excellent result.  

In latence terms, the monitor provides amazing image quality on a beautiful ultrawide display. Post calibration, it performed even better. 

The monitor also has several different modes. The first of which is called the Racing mode, designed to reduce input lag. There's also an RTS/RPG mode that helps saturation and contrast. Lastly, there's an FPS mode which further improves contrast. 

## Conclusion

This monitor boasts good looks and amazing performance. However, compared to lower priced competitors, it doesn't quite match up. 

The [Samsung S34E790C](http://amzn.to/2jsHUqe) seems to be a slightly better choice as far as price to performance goes. However, if you want the all out best widescreen 1440p monitor, this is the choice for you. 

If you're a competitive player, I recommend checking out the [BenQ ZOWIE XL2730](/best-1440p-gaming-monitors/benq-zowie-xl2730-review/) due to its crisp image quality, high refresh rate and low response time. 

However, if you want to immerse yourself in stunning 1440p, this is the display for you. We'd recommend this monitor for those who play games like Skyrim, GTA V, The Witcher 3, etc. 

All in all, if you have it in the budget, the ASUS ROG SWIFT PG348Q is a great piece of hardware.
