## Should you Buy a 1440p Monitor? 

While 1080p monitors have 2073600 pixels, 1440p monitors have 3686400 pixels. That is a 78% increase. Furthermore, 1440p monitors have a significantly higher [pixel density](http://www.tested.com/tech/371-why-pixel-density-matters-more-than-just-screen-size-or-resolution/). If you want the full experience of your gaming rig, 1440p is the way to go. 

The fine details of the display will be crisper and easier to see. In fast paced competitve games, being able to pick out the little details can give you the edge you need to win. 

Moreover, game developers spend lots of time making their games look beautiful. The numbers say 1440p is 78% more beautiful than 1080p. It's time to make the switch.

The [Acer K272HUL](http://amzn.to/2zGjIYX) is by far one of the best budget monitors. **You can snag this monitor for less than $300.** 

This monitor doesn't have the fastest refresh rate, but for the price it's an awesome deal. Though 144 Hz is ideal, you'll still experience extremely smooth gameplay in 60 FPS. 

Unfortunately like anything else in this world, you get what you pay for. While it's a great monitor overall, the color accuracy isn't superb compared to other higher end models. 

It has plenty of video inputs, including an HDMI and display port, as well as built in speakers (however, they're not that great). It's even VESA mountable. If you want an affordable 1440p gaming monitor without all of the extra fancy features, this is the monitor for you.

## Construction of the Monitor

This monitor was designed to fit a budget. Plastic is the material of choice for the monitor. It gets the job done, but you can definitely find monitors with a better build quality. 

The monitor is several inches thick, but flexes when a bit of pressure is applied. All in all, it's obvious that the monitor was designed with budget gamers in mind. 

## Controls

The control buttons of the monitor can be found on the lower right of the monitor. The controls allow the user to adjust contrast, color temperature, and brightness. 

Once more, if you're looking for a monitor with extra features and complex controls, you'll probably have to raise your budget a bit. 

## Functionality/Image Quality of the Monitor 
![K272 side](/img/1440p-monitors/k272-side.jpg){: .img-middle}


As far as functionality goes, it boasts superb image quality for the price. The [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) colors look phenomenal. 

The display quality is sufficient for the average joe on a budget. We found the image to be sharper and crisper compared to other monitors in this price range. 

## Conclusion

While the monitor is among the best in the price range, we recommend spending a bit of extra money for a higher quality monitor. 

If you're going to invest in a 1440p monitor, you might as well shell out the extra money for the better product. We say the [BenQ ZOWIE XL2730](http://amzn.to/2AIpdqs) is a better choice if you have the budget.
