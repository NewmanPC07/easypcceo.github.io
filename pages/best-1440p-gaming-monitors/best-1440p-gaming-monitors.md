## [Acer K272HUL](http://amzn.to/2zGjIYX){:target="_blank"} - $262
![Acer K272HUL](/img/1440p-monitors/k272.png){: .img-middle}


**1.** This is our pick for the budget-conscious gamers out there. This monitor is priced well for the high-resolution panel and solid performance. This monitor is one of Acer’s K series monitors, delivering top-notch digital content. 

The expansive LCD screen is equipped with a 2560x1440 resolution display along the [IPS panel](https://www.slrlounge.com/what-is-an-ips-monitor-understanding-ips-displays/){:target="_blank"}. With this monitor, you're guaranteed stunning images at all times. With a response time of 1 ms, you won't have to worry about lagging in game. If you are fond of playing fast-paced FPS games, you will benefit from this responsive monitor. 

The color accuracy is very impressive, with no hint of light bleeding in the backlight. Furthermore, there is not any shuttering or ghosting when playing a fast paced game. With the matte screen and IPS display, this monitor is a steal for the price.

## [BenQ ZOWIE XL2730](http://amzn.to/2AIpdqs){:target="_blank"} - $499
![BenQ ZOWIE](/img/1440p-monitors/zowie.png){: .img-middle}


**2.** If you have the extra money to spend, **this monitor is the best value for the money.** The BenQ ZOWIE XL2730 is listed just under $500 on Amazon. It's the perfect choice for any [e-sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports){:target="_blank"} enthusiasts. 

It has a [TN](http://www.tnpanel.com/tn-vs-ips-va/){:target="_blank"} panel capable of a 144hz refresh rate and a 1 ms response time. It has an anti-glare coating that does quite a good job of countering reflections, even if the monitor sits in front of your window. At the product’s native resolution of 2560×1440, details are sharp and crisp but not too tiny compared to 4k displays. Overall this resolution fits the 27-inch screen like a match made in heaven.

Although it may seem a bit too bland, the company is focusing on a less distracting design. The point of a nice monitor is to keep your eyes glued to the screen, not the accessories and unnecessary bling around it.

BenQ placed the bezel buttons on the front of the monitor. They glow white when the display is in use, and a nice light amber while on standby. If you are not a fan of the lighting, it can be disabled or adjusted in the [OSD](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/on-screen-display-OSD). On the left side of the cabinet, BenQ has provided two USB 3.0 slots for additional data accessories and audio jacks to suit your listening devices. 

This monitor even has a headphone hanger that pops out and retracts. At more than 7cm long, this is a lovely and convenient addition to the XL2730. This monitor fills in the gap between price and performance, providing gamers with a competition-grade display and a quick 1ms response time.

## [ASUS ROG SWIFT PG348Q](http://amzn.to/2yYkrYs){:target="_blank"} - $1200
![ASUS ROG SWIFT](/img/1440p-monitors/rog.png){: .img-middle}

**3.** The ASUS ROG SWIFT PG348Q is perfect for all the hardcore gamers out there willing to spend the money for the best quality. Although it is quite pricey, you'll be gaming on a monstrous 34-inch monitor that delivers outstanding performance. 

Gaming performance was top notch in many tests but seemed to run best when the refresh rate was at 100HZ. This monitor has rich, accurate colors and a sharp image display. It also offers a generous selection of gamer-friendly features, such as crosshair-aiming targets, on-the-fly refresh rate toggling, and several gaming picture presets.

There are no buttons on the front of the PG348Q. Instead, the Power switch, a five-way toggle button, and two hotkeys are located on the right-rear of the cabinet. One button is a GamePlus hotkey that launches a menu, allowing you to select one of four crosshair-aiming targets, set game timers, and enable a Frames-Per-Second (FPS) counter. The other key launches the Turbo Mode feature, where you can choose one of seven refresh rates, ranging from 60Hz to 100Hz.

This monitor is aesthetically pleasing, with its gorgeous looking stand and cool under-glow. It's the monitor of choice for a dream gaming setup. If potential buyers can get past the price tag, it's the best all-out gaming monitor.

![ASUS Designo MX27AQ](/img/1440p-monitors/asus-mx27aq.png){: .img-middle}


**4.** The ASUS Designo MX27AQ has it all. The IPS panel is absolutely stunning. It has a 27 inch display and delivers 100% sRGB colour space. It's even equipped with an awesome built-in speaker system and a 178-degree viewing angle.  

The audio quality of the monitor is also good, with stereo speakers powered by ICEpower, and a MobileSound 3 chip with ASUS SonicMaster tuning. 

This monitor's frameless display technology is especially appealing to those using a multi-monitor setup. The image quality is breathtaking, colors are vibrant, and the screen has a wide viewing angle. 

If you want a high quality screen and you're not worried about 4K resolution, this is the monitor for you.

![Dell UltraSharp](/img/1440p-monitors/1440p.png){: .img-middle}


**5.** This monitor is a favorite among gamers. The screen can be adjusted to just about any position and angle. You can control the OSD (on-screen display) menu with four buttons on the buttom right of the screen.  

The monitor has a flawless 25" display, delivering excellent performance for the price. It has awesome color reproduction and high-resolution. 

In addition, the monitor has a thin bezel design, giving it an 'edgeless' effect. It has a flexible stand, and a wide viewing angle. 

The monitor has a matte anti-glare display, delivering a crystal clear image without any reflection on the screen. 

The monitor has a refresh rate of 60Hz, which is on the low side for a gaming monitor. However, the monitor still refreshes 60 times per second, which is good for a 1440p monitor. You won't have any issues with ghosting or blurring. 

If you buy this monitor, you'll have a great 1440p gaming monitor at a reasonable price.

## [BenQ GW Series GW2765HT](http://amzn.to/2B5x5Fh){:target="_blank"} - $250
![BenQ GW Series GW2765HT](/img/1440p-monitors/benq.png){: .img-middle}


**6.** The BenQ GW Series GW2765HT features over 1 billion different colors. It has an HDMI port, DisplayPort, DVI port and a D-Sub port. 

BenQ has ventured past TN panels, now utilizing the beauty of IPS displays. The color accuracy is impeccable. The black level performance is pretty good too. Lastly, another benefit of the IPS panel is the wide (and awesome) viewing angle.

The monitor has a 60Hz refresh rate and a 4ms response time, which isn't anything too crazy. I'd recommend this monitor to the average gamer. If you're a competitive gamer, go for a monitor with a high refresh rate and a faster response time. 

Overall, this monitor is a fantastic mid-range gaming monitor. For $320, you're getting a dependable product with great image quality. The overall design of the monitor is fitting for most people.

## [Samsung S32D850T](http://amzn.to/2AGXWIq){:target="_blank"} - $380
![Samsung S32](/img/1440p-monitors/samsung-s32.png){: .img-middle}

**7.** This monitor is pretty decent considering its price. It has nearly 100% sRGB coverage and superb contrast ratio/color temperature. The color accuracy is impressive as well. Lastly, it features a slightly larger panel. This is great for players looking to be immersed in the game.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have the best brightness uniformity, and a slower response time of 5 ms. For the competitive gamers out there, this could be an issue. 

All in all, for the price it's not bad. While there are better options out there, you won't be disappointed with the display. If you're on a lower budget, this could be the monitor for you. 

However, the monitor is better suited for office work than gaming, so consider another 1440p monitor on this list.

**9.** Boasting excellent image quality, an IPS display, solid construction and an overall great gaming experience, the ASUS ROG SWIFT PG279Q is a popular pick. 

Aside from the price and minor control issues, we didn't really come across anything we didn't like while using this display. The color accuracy and refresh rate are both superb. 

The monitor has an attractive design, and an adjustable stand. Additionally, the color accuracy was superb, and the monitor has a high refresh rate of 165 Hz. 

All things considered, this is yet another great product from ASUS. It sets a new standard for G-Sync technology.

**10.** This monitor competes with higher-end displays at a lower price. It has a stylish design and features adaptive sync technology. 

Unfortunately, there isn't any height adjustability, and it has some problems with the viewing angle. 

Despite these cons, it's an awesome display for gamers looking to play 1440p games on a budget. If I were you, I'd definitely check it out.

**11.** This monitor's display is quite sharp, with a narrow 11mm bezel and a wide/deep base. It has a cable management hole to make your life a bit easier. 

The IPS panel provides superb image quality, however it lags behind TN panels in response time. Overall, it's a good monitor for the money. It'd make a great addition to your gaming setup.

**12.** This 34" monitor has a stellar contrast ratio, and overall excellent picture quality. It is an ultrawide monitor with a beautiful (and giant) display. The color accuracy is phenomenal, as is the design of the monitor. The only negative of the display is its speakers. 

They're not horrible, but they're not great either. Considering the price of the monitor, we'd expect a higher quality sound system. Of course, this problem is easily resolved with a great set of [gaming speakers](/best-gaming-speakers/).

Unlike the previous monitor, this display has powerful audio and a wireless charging station. Unfortunately there aren't any USB ports and the color accuracy isn't superb. 

All in all, we think it's a nice monitor with great added features including a wireless charging base, gamer-friendly settings and a high-quality sound system.

## The Ultimate 1440p Monitor Buyer's Guide 2018

I know there's a lot to consider when you're in the market for a new monitor. This guide is aimed to simplify the buying process by giving you all of the tools you need to make an informed decision. 

## 1440p VS. 4K Resolution

In our opinion, it's time for you to upgrade from 1080p to 1440p for *almost* all gamers. 

First of all unlike 4K monitors, 1440p monitors have come down in price a bit. There are [budget 1440p options](http://amzn.to/2zGjIYX){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"} out there well under $300. You don't have to break the bank to game in 1440p resolution. However, 4K is still pretty pricey. 

Second of all, it's pretty unlikely that your system can even handle 4K. It takes a pretty beefy setup to game in 4k with max settings. After all, if you're going to shell out the money for a 4k monitor, you'd probably be expecting the best possible settings. Unless you have at least a GTX 1070 (preferrably a GTX 1080 which can run over $700) than you probably won't be able to properly game in 4k. 

In addition, most games support 1440p resolution, but it's harder to find a well optimized game that seamlessly supports 4K resolution. All in all, 1440p makes more sense in 2018. 

## 1440p Monitors in 2018

You'll still need a good system to support 1440p gaming in 2018, but it's a heck of a lot easier than 4k. A GTX 1060 can support most games in 1440p resolution, and it's far cheaper than a 1070 or 1080. 

[High Ground Gaming](https://www.highgroundgaming.com/best-1440p-gaming-monitors/){:target="_blank"} has a fantastic graphic showing the differences between resolutions. Here it is: 

![Resolution Math](/img/1440p-monitors/resolution-math.png)

1440p is short for 2560 x 1440 pixels. That comes out to 3,686,500 million pixels. Compared to 4K's 8,294,400 pixels, 1440p will be far easier on your GPU.

1440p has 1.5 million more pixels than 1080p. That's a whole heck of a lot! If you're going to run games in 1440p, we recommend a GPU with a good amount of dedicated ram. The [ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060 Mini](http://amzn.to/2Agzqwx){:target="_blank"} has 6GB of dedicated ram, and it's less than $300. It's a great budget card that can handle 1440p. **Try to find a card with at least 4GB of ram.**

## Why do you Need a Powerful GPU for 1440p? 

1440p monitors have a higher pixel density than older, lower resolution monitors. Just about all of the graphical processing and 3D rendering takes place in the GPU. 

Right now, the magic number for high-resolution gaming seems to be 6GB. Most cards at this time can only push through 30 FPS at 4K resolutions. This is due to limitations of the GPU core. 

1440p is a bit more realistic, as GPU cores have the power necessary to process the high-resolution.

## The Importance of a Gaming Monitor 

While you can play games on any old TV with an HDMI input, why settle for less? 

True gaming monitors offer stunning resolutions, vibrant colors, and lightning-fast response times. As a member of the PC gaming master race, you deserve the best possible gaming experience. Don't limit yourself with an old television. 

Furthermore, if you spend $500, $800, $1000 or more on a gaming PC, you'll want the full experience. If your PC is capable of gaming in 1440p, why game in 720p or 1080p? If you're only going to use a low resolution TV, there's no point in building a gaming PC. You might as well stick to console. 

## Why Upgrade from 1080p?

1080p monitors have become a staple of PC gaming in 2018, and for good reason. The display is pretty good, not to mention they're cheap as well. For most, 1080p is sufficient. However, if you have the extra money, we strongly recommend the upgrade to 1440p.

Why?

While 1080p monitors have 2073600 pixels, 1440p monitors have 3686400 pixels. That is a 78% increase. Furthermore, 1440p monitors have a significantly higher [pixel density](http://www.tested.com/tech/371-why-pixel-density-matters-more-than-just-screen-size-or-resolution/){:target="_blank"}. If you want the full experience of your gaming rig, 1440p is the way to go. 

The fine details of the display will be crisper and easier to see. In fast-paced competitive games, being able to pick out the little details can give you the edge you need to win. Moreover, game developers spend lots of time making their games look beautiful. The numbers say 1440p is 78% more beautiful than 1080p. It's time to make the switch.

## 8 Things to Consider BEFORE You Buy a 1440p Gaming Monitor

## 3 More Things to Keep in Mind: 

* **Do you have the hardware?:** While 1440p gaming is awesome, not everyone can experience the luxury. First of all, it can be pretty darn expensive, as you have to buy a 1440p monitor. This is only the beginning. The real challenge is building a gaming PC that can handle this high-resolution. Your GPU will have to process 78% more pixels, which isn't easy. Luckily for you, we have gaming PCs capable of flawless 1440p gaming for as low as $800. If this is in your budget, then go for it! 

* **Is it worth it for you?:** 1440p gaming is really only for PC gaming enthusiasts and competitive e-sports players. While 1440p gaming is nice, it may not be worth the money for you. If you're okay with 1080p, it's much cheaper and definitely not a bad alternative. 

* **Are you due for an upgrade?:** If you're already in the market for a new monitor, you might as well upgrade to a 1440p monitor instead of a new 1080p monitor. Even if your current gaming PC isn't up to par, you probably only need to upgrade your [GPU](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/43886/gpu){:target="_blank"} anyway. That being said, you won't have to buy an entirely new rig for 1440p gaming. A GTX 1060 can handle 1440p gaming with most titles, and a GTX 1070 is even better. 

## Why Do You Need a High Refresh Rate? 

Even if you decide to buy a 1080p monitor, you should still find one with a high refresh rate. Don't settle for anything less than 60 Hz, but the more the better. A 144 Hz monitor is ideal.

How does refresh rate affect your gaming experience?

Well, it's quite simple. A 60 Hz monitor refreshes 60 times per second. A 144 Hz monitor refreshes 144 times per second. 

What's the big deal?

If your gaming PC is achieving 100+ fps, yet your monitor only refreshes 60 times per second, you won't be getting the most out of your gaming PC. You'll only be able to see 60 fps, even if your PC is capable of more. 

Some may say humans can't tell the difference after 30 fps. While this may be true if you're watching television, gaming is different.

When you are gaming, the game has to respond and adjust itself to you via the keyboard and mouse. That being said, you can feel how smooth a game runs. It would be a waste of money to buy a nice gaming PC without the right monitor to accompany it.

## What is an Acceptable Response Time? 

This question is a bit broad. It depends on what kind of games you're playing. If you're a casual gamer, it isn't really a big deal. However, if you're a competitive fps/e-sports player, the lower the better. 

In general, I'd say anything below 6 ms is acceptable. Anything higher is a bit too much for gaming. Ideally, 5 ms or lower is the best. If you're a competitive gamer, you need every edge you can get to win. You should look for a monitor with a 1 ms response time. 

## 1440p Gaming Monitor FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

I get a lot of questions about 1440p gaming, so I decided to make this FAQ section in an effort to answer the most common ones! 

**Is 1440p gaming worth the money?** While this is just my opinion, I believe it is. If you'd asked this question two years ago, I would've told you to stick with 1080p gaming. However, things have changed. It's becoming both more affordable and convenient to game in 1080p. If you've never laid your eyes on a 1440p gaming monitor, you don't understand how much better looking a 1440p display is, as opposed to a 1080p display. 

**What hardware do I need to game in 1440p?** Unfortunately, if your budget is less than $700, you're better off sticking to 1080p gaming. In order to game in 1440p with a decent framerate and graphical settings, you're going to want at least an RX 580 8GB, although I'd recommend the GTX 1070. As far as the CPU is concerned, go for a Ryzen 5 1400 or an Intel Core i5. Lastly, you're going to want *at least* 8GB of RAM, although 16GB is optimal. 

**Do I need a special HDMI cable for 1440p?** Check your cable's specifications to see what it supports. Different cables have better graphical quality than others (VGA, DVI, HDMI, etc.)

**Does resolution affect framerate?** Yes, as you increase resolution, your GPU has to work harder to render more pixels. If you have a powerful GPU like a GTX 1070, framerate shouldn't be an issue. 

**What's better, 1080p with high settings or 1440p with low settings?** In my experience, it depends on the game, but in general I'd say I prefer 1440p over 1080p no matter the settings. 

**What refresh rate should I look for?** This is an often debated topic. If you buy a 60Hz monitor and you're getting 100FPS, your eye will only see 60FPS. However, even if you had a 144Hz monitor, your eye is not capable of seeing 144 frames per second. Most movies are 30 FPS or less. Although, when you're playing you can feel the movements, so more FPS is better. My monitor is 60Hz and I don't have any complaints. In all honesty, a 60Hz monitor is probably fine unless you're an extremely competitive gamer.
