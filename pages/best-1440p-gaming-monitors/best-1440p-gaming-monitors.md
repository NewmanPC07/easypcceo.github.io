## The Ultimate 1440p Monitor Buyer's Guide 2017

I know there's a lot to consider when you're in the market for a new monitor. This guide is aimed to simplify the buying process by giving you all of the tools you need to make an informed decision. 

## 1440p VS. 4K Resolution

In our opinion, it's time for you to upgrade from 1080p to 1440p for *almost* all gamers. 

First of all unlike 4K monitors, 1440p monitors have come down in price a bit. There are [budget 1440p options](http://amzn.to/2zGjIYX) out there well under $300. You don't have to break the bank to game in 1440p resolution. However, 4K is still pretty pricey. 

Second of all, it's pretty unlikely that your system can even handle 4K. It takes a pretty beefy setup to game in 4k with max settings. After all, if you're going to shell out the money for a 4k monitor, you'd probably be expecting the best possible settings. Unless you have at least a GTX 1070 (preferrably a GTX 1080 which can run over $700) than you probably won't be able to properly game in 4k. 

In addition, most games support 1440p resolution, but it's harder to find a well optimized game that seamlessly supports 4K resolution. All in all, 1440p makes more sense in 2017. 

## 1440p Monitors in 2017

You'll still need a good system to support 1440p gaming in 2017, but it's a heck of a lot easier than 4k. A GTX 1060 can support most games in 1440p resolution, and it's far cheaper than a 1070 or 1080. 

[High Ground Gaming](https://www.highgroundgaming.com/best-1440p-gaming-monitors/) has a fantastic graphic showing the differences between resolutions. Here it is: 

![Resolution Math](/img/1440p-monitors/resolution-math.png)

1440p is short for 2560 x 1440 pixels. That comes out to 3,686,500 million pixels. Compared to 4K's 8,294,400 pixels, 1440p will be far easier on your GPU.

1440p has 1.5 million more pixels than 1080p. That's a whole heck of a lot! If you're going to run games in 1440p, we recommend a GPU with a good amount of dedicated ram. The [ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060 Mini](http://amzn.to/2Agzqwx) has 6GB of dedicated ram, and it's less than $300. It's a great budget card that can handle 1440p. **Try to find a card with at least 4GB of ram.**

## Why do you Need a Powerful GPU for 1440p? 

1440p monitors have a higher pixel density than older, lower resolution monitors. Just about all of the graphical processing and 3D rendering takes place in the GPU. 

Right now, the magic number for high resolution gaming seems to be 6GB. Most cards at this time can only push through 30 FPS at 4K resolutions. This is due to limitations of the GPU core. 

1440p is a bit more realistic, as GPU cores have the power necessary to process the high resolution.

## The Importance of a Gaming Monitor 

While you can play games on any old TV with an HDMI input, why settle for less? 

True gaming monitors offer stunning resolutions, vibrant colors, and lightning fast response times. As a member of the PC gaming master race, you deserve the best possible gaming experience. Don't limit yourself with an old television. 

Furthermore, if you spend $500, $800, $1000 or more on a gaming PC, you'll want the full experience. If your PC is capable of gaming in 1440p, why game in 720p or 1080p? If you're only going to use a low resolution TV, there's no point in building a gaming PC. You might as well stick to console. 

## Why Upgrade from 1080p? 
![Triple Monitor Setup](/img/1440p-monitors/trio.jpg)

1080p monitors have become a staple of PC gaming in 2017, and for good reason. The display is pretty good, not to mention they're cheap as well. For most, 1080p is sufficient. However, if you have the extra money, we strongly recommend the upgrade to 1440p.

Why?

While 1080p monitors have 2073600 pixels, 1440p monitors have 3686400 pixels. That is a 78% increase. Furthermore, 1440p monitors have a significantly higher [pixel density](http://www.tested.com/tech/371-why-pixel-density-matters-more-than-just-screen-size-or-resolution/). If you want the full experience of your gaming rig, 1440p is the way to go. 

The fine details of the display will be crisper and easier to see. In fast paced competitve games, being able to pick out the little details can give you the edge you need to win. Moreover, game developers spend lots of time making their games look beautiful. The numbers say 1440p is 78% more beautiful than 1080p. It's time to make the switch.

## 8 Things to Consider BEFORE You Buy a 1440p Gaming Monitor

![Infographic](/img/infographic/1440p-monitor-infographic.png)

## 3 More Things to Keep in Mind: 

* **Do you have the hardware?:** While 1440p gaming is awesome, not everyone can experience the luxury. First of all, it can be pretty darn expensive, as you have to buy a 1440p monitor. This is only the beginning. The real challenge is building a gaming PC that can handle this high resolution. Your GPU will have to process 78% more pixels, which isn't easy. Luckily for you, we have gaming PCs capable of flawless 1440p gaming for as low as $800. If this is in your budget, then go for it! 

* **Is it worth it for you?:** 1440p gaming is really only for PC gaming enthusiasts and competitive e-sports players. While 1440p gaming is nice, it may not be worth the money for you. If you're okay with 1080p, it's much cheaper and definitely not a bad alternative. 

* **Are you due for an upgrade?:** If you're already in the market for a new monitor, you might as well upgrade to a 1440p monitor instead of a new 1080p monitor. Even if your current gaming PC isn't up to par, you probably only need to upgrade your [GPU](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/43886/gpu) anyway. That being said, you won't have to buy an entirely new rig for 1440p gaming. A GTX 1060 can handle 1440p gaming with most titles, and a GTX 1070 is even better. 

## Why Do You Need a High Refresh Rate? 

Even if you decide to buy a 1080p monitor, you should still find one with a high refresh rate. Don't settle for anything less than 60 Hz, but the more the better. A 144 Hz monitor is ideal.

How does refresh rate affect your gaming experience?

Well, it's quite simple. A 60 Hz monitor refreshes 60 times per second. A 144 Hz monitor refreshes 144 times per second. 

What's the big deal?

If your gaming PC is achieving 100+ fps, yet your monitor only refreshes 60 times per second, you won't be getting the most out of your gaming PC. You'll only be able to see 60 fps, even if your PC is capable of more. 

Some may say humans can't tell the difference after 30 fps. While this may be true if you're watching television, gaming is different.

When you are gaming, the game has to respond and adjust itself to you via the keyboard and mouse. That being said, you can feel how smooth a game runs. It would be a waste of money to buy a nice gaming PC without the right monitor to accompany it. 

## What is an Acceptable Response Time? 

This question is a bit broad. It depends on what kind of games you're playing. If you're a casual gamer, it isn't really a big deal. However, if you're a competitive fps/e-sports player, the lower the better. 

In general, I'd say anything below 6 ms is acceptable. Anything higher is a bit too much for gaming. Ideally, 5 ms or lower is the best. If you're a competitive gamer, you need every edge you can get to win. You should look for a monitor with a 1 ms response time. 

## [Acer K272HUL](http://amzn.to/2zGjIYX) - $262
![Acer K272HUL](/img/1440p-monitors/k272.png){: .img-middle}

**2.** If you have the extra money to spend, **this monitor is the best value for the money.** The BenQ ZOWIE XL2730 is listed just under $500 on Amazon. It's the perfect choice for any [e-sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) enthusiasts. 

It has a [TN](http://www.tnpanel.com/tn-vs-ips-va/) panel capable of a 144hz refresh rate and a 1 ms response time. It has an anti-glare coating that does quite a good job of countering reflections, even if the monitor sits in front of your window. At the product’s native resolution of 2560×1440, details are sharp and crisp but not too tiny compared to 4k displays. Overall this resolution fits the 27-inch screen like a match made in heaven.

Although it may seem a bit too bland, the company is focusing on a less distracting design. The point of a nice monitor is to keep your eyes glued to the screen, not the accessories and unnecessary bling around it.

BenQ placed the bezel buttons on the front of the montior. They glow white white when the display is in use, and a nice light amber while on standby. If you are not a fan of the lighting, it can be disabled or adjusted in the [OSD](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/on-screen-display-OSD). On the left side of the cabinet, BenQ has provided two USB 3.0 slots for additional data accessories and audio jacks to suit your listening devices. 

This monitor even has a headphone hanger that pops out and retracts. At more than 7cm long, this is a lovely and convenient addition to the XL2730. This monitor fills in the gap between price and performance, providing gamers with a competition-grade display and a quick 1ms response time. 

**Specs:**

* Display size: 27"
* Display resolution: 2560x1440
* Aspect ratio: 16:9
* Refresh rate: 144 Hz
* Response time: 1 ms
