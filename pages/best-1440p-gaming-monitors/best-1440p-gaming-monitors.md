## The Importance of a Gaming Monitor 

While you can play games on any old TV with an HDMI input, why settle for less? 

True gaming monitors offer stunning resolutions, vibrant colors, and lightning fast response times. As a member of the PC gaming master race, you deserve the best possible gaming experience. Don't limit yourself with an old television. 

Furthermore, if you spend $500, $800, $1000 or more on a gaming PC, you'll want the full experience. If your PC is capable of gaming in 1440p, why game in 720p or 1080p? If you're only going to use a low resolution TV, there's no point in building a gaming PC. You might as well stick to console. 

## Why Upgrade from 1080p? 
![Triple Monitor Setup](/img/1440p-monitors/trio.jpg)

1080p monitors have become a staple of PC gaming in 2017, and for good reason. The display is pretty good, not to mention they're cheap as well. For most, 1080p is sufficient. However, if you have the extra money, we strongly recommend the upgrade to 1440p.

Why?

While 1080p monitors have 2073600 pixels, 1440p monitors have 3686400 pixels. That is a 78% increase. Furthermore, 1440p monitors have a significantly higher [pixel density](http://www.tested.com/tech/371-why-pixel-density-matters-more-than-just-screen-size-or-resolution/). If you want the full experience of your gaming rig, 1440p is the way to go. 

The fine details of the display will be crisper and easier to see. In fast paced competitve games, being able to pick out the little details can give you the edge you need to win. Moreover, game developers spend lots of time making their games look beautiful. The numbers say 1440p is 78% more beautiful than 1080p. It's time to make the switch.

## 8 Things to Consider BEFORE You Buy a 1440p Gaming Monitor

![Infographic](/img/infographic/1440p-monitor-infographic.png)

## 3 More Things to Keep in Mind: 

* **Do you have the hardware?:** While 1440p gaming is awesome, not everyone can experience the luxury. First of all, it can be pretty darn expensive, as you have to buy a 1440p monitor. This is only the beginning. The real challenge is building a gaming PC that can handle this high resolution. Your GPU will have to process 78% more pixels, which isn't easy. Luckily for you, we have gaming PCs capable of flawless 1440p gaming for as low as $800. If this is in your budget, then go for it! 

* **Is it worth it for you?:** 1440p gaming is really only for PC gaming enthusiasts and competitive e-sports players. While 1440p gaming is nice, it may not be worth the money for you. If you're okay with 1080p, it's much cheaper and definitely not a bad alternative. 

* **Are you due for an upgrade?:** If you're already in the market for a new monitor, you might as well upgrade to a 1440p monitor instead of a new 1080p monitor. Even if your current gaming PC isn't up to par, you probably only need to upgrade your [GPU](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/43886/gpu) anyway. That being said, you won't have to buy an entirely new rig for 1440p gaming. A GTX 1060 can handle 1440p gaming with most titles, and a GTX 1070 is even better. 

## Why Do You Need a High Refresh Rate? 

Even if you decide to buy a 1080p monitor, you should still find one with a high refresh rate. Don't settle for anything less than 60 Hz, but the more the better. A 144 Hz monitor is ideal.

How does refresh rate affect your gaming experience?

Well, it's quite simple. A 60 Hz monitor refreshes 60 times per second. A 144 Hz monitor refreshes 144 times per second. 

What's the big deal?

{:toc}

If your gaming PC is achieving 100+ fps, yet your monitor only refreshes 60 times per second, you won't be getting the most out of your gaming PC. You'll only be able to see 60 fps, even if your PC is capable of more. 

Some may say humans can't tell the difference after 30 fps. While this may be true if you're watching television, gaming is different.

When you are gaming, the game has to respond and adjust itself to you via the keyboard and mouse. That being said, you can feel how smooth a game runs. It would be a waste of money to buy a nice gaming PC without the right monitor to accompany it. 

## What is an Acceptable Response Time? 

This question is a bit broad. It depends on what kind of games you're playing. If you're a casual gamer, it isn't really a big deal. However, if you're a competitive fps/e-sports player, the lower the better. 

In general, I'd say anything below 6 ms is acceptable. Anything higher is a bit too much for gaming. Ideally, 5 ms or lower is the best. If you're a competitive gamer, you need every edge you can get to win. You should look for a monitor with a 1 ms response time.
