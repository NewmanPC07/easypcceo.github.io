**2.** If you have the extra money to spend, **this monitor is the best value for the money.** The BenQ ZOWIE XL2730 is listed just under $500 on Amazon. It's the perfect choice for any [e-sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) enthusiasts. 

It has a [TN](http://www.tnpanel.com/tn-vs-ips-va/) panel capable of a 144hz refresh rate and a 1 ms response time. It has an anti-glare coating that does quite a good job of countering reflections, even if the monitor sits in front of your window. At the product’s native resolution of 2560×1440, details are sharp and crisp but not too tiny compared to 4k displays. Overall this resolution fits the 27-inch screen like a match made in heaven.

Although it may seem a bit too bland, the company is focusing on a less distracting design. The point of a nice monitor is to keep your eyes glued to the screen, not the accessories and unnecessary bling around it.

BenQ placed the bezel buttons on the front of the montior. They glow white white when the display is in use, and a nice light amber while on standby. If you are not a fan of the lighting, it can be disabled or adjusted in the [OSD](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/on-screen-display-OSD). On the left side of the cabinet, BenQ has provided two USB 3.0 slots for additional data accessories and audio jacks to suit your listening devices. 

This monitor even has a headphone hanger that pops out and retracts. At more than 7cm long, this is a lovely and convenient addition to the XL2730. This monitor fills in the gap between price and performance, providing gamers with a competition-grade display and a quick 1ms response time. 

**Specs:**

* Display size: 27"
* Display resolution: 2560x1440

* Refresh rate: 144 Hz

**3.** The ASUS ROG SWIFT PG348Q is perfect for all the hardcore gamers out there willing to spend the money for the best quality. Although it is quite pricey, you'll be gaming on a monstrous 34-inch monitor that delivers outstanding performance. 

Gaming performance was top notch in many tests but seemed to run best when the refresh rate was at 100HZ. This monitor has rich, accurate colors and a sharp image display. It also offers a generous selection of gamer-friendly features, such as crosshair-aiming targets, on-the-fly refresh rate toggling, and several gaming picture presets.

There are no buttons on the front of the PG348Q. Instead, the Power switch, a five-way toggle button, and two hot keys are located on the right-rear of the cabinet. One button is a GamePlus hotkey that launches a menu, allowing you to select one of four crosshair-aiming targets, set game timers, and enable a Frames-Per-Second (FPS) counter. The other key launches the Turbo Mode feature, where you can choose one of seven refresh rates, ranging from 60Hz to 100Hz.

This monitor is aesthetically pleasing, with its gorgeous looking stand and cool under-glow. It's the monitor of choice for a dream gaming setup. If potential buyers can get past the price tag, it's the best all out gaming monitor.
