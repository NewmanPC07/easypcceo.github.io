## Construction of the Monitor

The monitor's overall appearance is sleek and refined. The company focused on a minimalist design in order to provide further attention to the functionality of the monitor. It has two USB 3.0 slots on the left side as well as audio jacks. It even has a headset hanger that comes out and retracts with the touch of a finger. 

You can spend a fortune on a cool looking gaming PC case, or you can spend less money on a case that does the same thing with less flashy features. 

Similarly, you can spend a fortune on a gaming monitor with a bunch of unnecessary features, or you can save money and focus on the functionality of the monitor. After all, you're going to spend your time looking at the screen, aren't you?  

The monitor has a matte-black finish. It doesn't reflect light at all which is great. I hate seeing a glare when I look at my monitor. All in all, it has a sturdy construction and it gets the job done. 

## Controls

The bezel of the monitor has five buttons on the lower-right side. They glow white while the monitor is in use, and an amber color while on standby. If you don't like this feature it can be disabled in the OSD.  

## Functionality/Image Quality of the Monitor

The XL2730 utilizes TN panel technology, allowing for a high refresh rate and low response time. The anti-glare coating does the monitor justice, eliminating any distracting reflections on the screen. 

Before you buy this monitor, make sure your computer is up to the task. If your computer can't handle the native resolution of 2560 x 1440, maybe consider a 1080p monitor.  

The monitor is a spectacular choice if you're a competitive [E-sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESports) gamer. This is not only thanks to the spectacular image quality, but to the high refresh rate and low respone time as well. 

If you're a competitive gamer (the target audience of this monitor) then you'll benefit greatly from the TN panel technology. The 144 Hz refresh rate allows you to truly see 144 FPS in game. If you're playing a title such as CSGO, having the smoothest gameplay can be the competitive edge you need to win. 

Furthermore, the 1 ms respone time gives you the competitive edge you need to beat a player with a 5 ms response time. 

## Conclusion

The XL2730 performs pretty well for the price, rendering it the best 1440p monitor for the money. 

The limitations normally associated with a TN panel not a problem with the XL2730. It boasts incredible performance for the price. 

All in all, it's a great monitor. If you're in the market for a new 1440p gaming monitor, this is the best value for your money.
