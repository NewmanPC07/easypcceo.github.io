If you're looking for the most bang for your buck, a desktop gaming PC is the best route to take.

Why? 

Not only are the parts cheaper, they're faster too. 

However, if you want power and performance packed into a portable device, a gaming laptop is the choice for you.

Good gaming laptops are hard to come by. Most of them are either overpriced and slow, or big, bulky, and loud.

Is it possible to find a powerful and sleek gaming PC for a great price? 

The answer is yes.

## [The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming Laptop - $780](http://amzn.to/2vFtMkF)

This gaming laptop is insanely powerful given its relatively low price tag. 

### Display

It rocks a 15.6" 1080p display. It has as 60 Hz refresh rate which is great for gamers. 

Unfortunately the viewing angle isn't amazing, but it's not a big deal for a gaming PC.

### Keyboard/Mousepad 

The keyboard is backlit, and it has a solid construction. Not the best keyboard on the market, but the keys are definitely crisp and responsive.

The mousepad is quite responsive, and the tracking is precise. It's not a cheap mousepad that will break shortly after purchase.

### Sound System

There's something else really cool about this laptop:

It actually has a solid sound system. The bottom of the laptop has a small sub, which provides crisper and more defined sound. 

### Webcam/Microphone

This laptop also comes with a 720p webcam and a built in microphone. The webcam works well for video calls, but I wouldn't recommend recording with it. The same can be said about the mic. 

### Internal Specifications

The laptop is rocking a core i5-7300HQ quad core Kaby Lake CPU. It also has dedicated GTX 1050 graphics, 8 GB of DDR4 ram, and a 256GB SSD. 

As you can probably tell, you're getting an extremely powerful laptop for a great price. This laptop is more than capable of 1080p gaming.  

This laptop can easily run games like Minecraft, Battlefield 1, Overwatch, GTA V, Rainbow Six Siege, and more. 

### Upgradability

The inside of this laptop leaves lots of room for upgrade. It comes with an empty 2.5" drive bay, allowing for another hard drive to be installed. It also allows an easy RAM upgrade to 16 or even 32 GB.

## Pros of the Dell Inspiron 15 7000

### Powerful Components 

The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is less than $800, but it's packed full of fast parts. It has a solid CPU and GPU, as well as plenty of ram and a fast SSD. 

### Great Gaming Performance 

This laptop can game in 1080p with ease. It'll achieve at least 60 fps in most titles at high settings. 

### Room for Future Upgrade

The inside of the laptop is clean and easy to work with. It leaves room for future upgrades if you want more storage or ram. 

### 1080p Display

While some laptops have a low quality display that's less than 1080p, this laptop is sporting a full 1080p display. 

## Cons of the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 

### Average Battery Life

This laptop's battery is average at best. It's not the worst battery, but it's not the greatest either. This is to be expected from such a powerful gaming PC. 

### Small Viewing Angle 

Though the screen is 1080p, the viewing angle seems to be small. It looks great if you're looking directly at it, but if you move to the side, the screen seems to wash out. 

### Low Storage 

This laptop ships with a 240 GB SSD. Though the SSD is much faster than any HDD that most laptops have, it still only has 240 GB. After a few games, movies, and programs, you'll soon find yourself running out of space. 

Fortunately, the laptop leaves plenty of room to upgrade. You can always add a second hard drive, or buy an external USB storage unit. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, this is a great gaming laptop. Some of the features aren't as great as other laptops, including the webcam and built in microphone. However, it's evident that the developers focused on the components of the computer. 

At the end of the day, that's what matters for gaming. From a purely gaming perspective, it's an excellent laptop at an excellent price. 

This laptop is also great at other workstation tasks as well, including recording, editing, redndering, etc. 

All in all, if you're looking for a superb portable gaming machine, this laptop is the one for you.
