The CPU market has taken a huge step forward ever since the launch of Ryzen 3. PC gaming on a budget has never been easier. 

The last time I made a list of the top 5 best gaming CPUs, Ryzen 3 wasn't released. Actually, I didn't even include Ryzen 5 in my list. As this is obviously unacceptable, it's time for the top 5 best gaming CPUs of 2017. 

Keep in mind that this list isn't necessarily in order from worst to best, but more so in order of price to performance. 

## 5. [Pentium G4560 ($80)](http://amzn.to/2i4vwPM)

The Pentium G4560 definitely still has a place on the top 5 list. This CPU is less than $100, and still can compete with i3 CPUs. 

In fact, it can keep up with CPUs such as the Intel i3-7100 in gaming related tasks. Furthermore, for $80, it really holds its own in other workstation tasks as well. 

Intel definitely saw Ryzen coming and decided to implement hyperthreading with their Pentium CPUs. This blurred the lines between Pentium and core i3. 

Especially after the release of Ryzen 3, it makes no sense to purchase an i3 CPU. Either go for the Pentium G4560, or go for the Ryzen 3.

The reason the Pentium G4560 made the list is because of its insane price to performance ratio. Since it has 4 threads, it performs extremely well in gaming. 

We'd recommend spending the extra money on the Ryzen 3 1200, but if you really can't afford it, the Pentium G4560 will do just fine.  

The Pentium G4560 may not be as powerful as the i3-7100, but it's extremely close. Furthermore, if you look at it from a price to performance standpoint, the G4560 makes much more sense. 

If you want the most bang from your buck, go with the Pentium G4560.

As you can see in the graph above, the i3-7100 is only 12% faster than the Pentium G4560, but it is 28% more expensive. 

Evidently, the i3-7100 is not worth your money, especially considering Ryzen 3 outperforms it in nearly every aspect for a lower price tag. 

In conclusion, if you're on an extremely low budget, the Intel Pentium G4560 is your best friend.
