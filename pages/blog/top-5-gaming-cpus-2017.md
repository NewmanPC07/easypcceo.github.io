The CPU market has taken a huge step forward ever since the launch of Ryzen 3. PC gaming on a budget has never been easier. 

The last time I made a list of the top 5 best gaming CPUs, Ryzen 3 wasn't released. Actually, I didn't even include Ryzen 5 in my list. As this is obviously unacceptable, it's time for the top 5 best gaming CPUs of 2017. 

Keep in mind that this list isn't necessarily in order from worst to best, but more so in order of price to performance. 

## 5. [Pentium G4560 ($80)](http://amzn.to/2i4vwPM) 

The Pentium G4560 definitely still has a place on the top 5 list. This CPU is less than $100, and still can compete with i3 CPUs.

In fact, it can keep up with CPUs such as the Intel i3-7100 in gaming related tasks. Furthermore, for $80, it really holds its own in other workstation tasks as well. 

Intel definitely saw Ryzen coming and decided to implement hyperthreading with their Pentium CPUs. This blurred the lines between Pentium and core i3. 

Especially after the release of Ryzen 3, it makes no sense to purchase an i3 CPU. Either go for the Pentium G4560, or go for the Ryzen 3. 

The reason the Pentium G4560 made the list is because of its insane price to performance ratio. Since it has 4 threads, it performs extremely well in gaming. 

We'd recommend spending the extra money on the Ryzen 3 1200, but if you really can't afford it, the Pentium G4560 will do just fine.  

The Pentium G4560 may not be as powerful as the i3-7100, but it's extremely close. Furthermore, if you look at it from a price to performance standpoint, the G4560 makes much more sense. 

If you want the most bang from your buck, go with the Pentium G4560. Below is a graph comparing the multithreaded performance of the Pentium G4560 and the i3-7100. 

Considering the CPU is hyperthreaded, multithread performance is important.

As you can see in the graph above, the i3-7100 is only 12% faster than the Pentium G4560, but it is 28% more expensive. 

Evidently, the i3-7100 is not worth your money, especially considering Ryzen 3 outperforms it in nearly every aspect for a lower price tag. 

In conclusion, if you're on an extremely low budget, the Intel Pentium G4560 is your best friend.

## 4. [Ryzen 3 1200 - $110](http://amzn.to/2wO0mPP)

The Ryzen 3 1200 is easily one of the best choices if you're on a budget.

Though the performance is similar to the core i3-7100 before overclocking, the Ryzen 3 1200 significantly outperforms the i3-7100 in nearly all aspects when overclocked. 

After overclocking, the Ryzen 3 1200 achieves similar performance the the 1300X for a much cheaper price tag. 

Moreover, the Ryzen 3 1200 and 1300X significantly outperform both of Intel's closest offerings.

Ryzen 3 has 4 true cores, unlike both of Intel's closest offerings. It is also made up of two of AMD's new CCXs or Core Complexes.

This means that even though the Ryzen 3 1200 only has half the cache of the Ryzen 5 and 7, it still has all of the same features. 

This includes SenseMI, Precision Boost, and XFR. Considering you're getting all of these awesome features at such a low price, it really is a great value. 

In addition, Ryzen 3's stealth coolers are far better equipped than Intel's stock coolers. They provide quiet and adequate cooling. They even support light overclocking.

Ryzen 3 is the king of budget gaming CPUs. If you're on a low budget, I'd highly recommend this CPU. 

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.1 GHz
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz 
* Cores: 4 
* Lithography: 14 nm
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Includes CPU Cooler: Yes
* Simultaneous Multithreading: No
* Integrated Graphics: No

## 3. [Ryzen 5 1400 - $160](http://amzn.to/2v09H4T)
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/blog/top-cpu-2017/ryzen5-1400.jpg){: .img-small .img-right}

The Ryzen 5 1600 is an excellent choice for a gaming CPU. It is unchallenenged among enthusiast CPUs. 

However, if you can't afford the $220 price tag, the Ryzen 5 1400 is a much more budget oriented option. 

This quad-core CPU is great for those who can't afford the extra $50 for a Ryzen 5 1600. If you're on a tight budget, the extra $50 can be allocated in a more important part of the build, like the GPU. 

Still, the Ryzen 5 1400 is a great chip. Compared to Intel's closest offering, the core i5-7400, the Ryzen 5 1400 outperforms team blue once again.
