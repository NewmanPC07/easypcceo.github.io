## [Cheap Mouse for League of Legends: Mionix Castor Multi-Color Ergonomic Optical Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2A8rzT0){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2A8rzT0"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Mionix Castor Multi-Color Ergonomic Optical Gaming Mouse" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/mionix-castor.jpg" /></a>

The [Mionix Castor Multi-Color Ergonomic Optical Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2A8rzT0){: target="_blank"} is suited for right-handed gamers, and it is compatible with every mouse grip style. 

The mouse has six programmable [macro](https://insider.razer.com/index.php?threads/what-are-macros.19193/){: target="_blank"} buttons – moreover, it has pinky and ring finger support, which helps to prevent hand cramps even after hours of gaming. 

The Mionix Castor comes in multiple colors which are highly customizable (over 16.8 million options). 

Now onto performance: is the Mionix Castor League of Legends worthy? 

The answer is yes.

The mouse ships with a 5,000[DPI](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/dpi-switch-mouse-66055.html){: target="_blank"} sensor. The cursor was responsive, and my mouse movements were smooth. Additionally, its ergonomic design keeps my hand comfortable, even after hours of use. 

The mouse is especially well suited for League because of its six programmable buttons. If you’re playing LOL competitively, programmable buttons are important.

## [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n){: target="_blank"} 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Deathadder Elite" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-deathadder-elite.jpg" /></a>

The Razer DeathAdder Elite came out during DeathAdder’s 10th anniversary back in 2016. 

It is a wired mouse, with a maximum DPI of 16,000 and a max [polling rate](https://www.howtogeek.com/182702/mouse-dpi-and-polling-rates-explained-do-they-matter-for-gaming/){: target="_blank"} of 1000Hz – evidently, the mouse’s specifications are impressive. During my tests, I thoroughly enjoyed using the mouse.

So much so, in fact, I decided to use it in my PC gaming setup. I’ve been using the DeathAdder Elite for several years, without any complaints!

Although the Elite has a similar design to other DeathAdder models, it features several additional programmable buttons, which are great for League of Legends. There is a sleek curve to both sides of the mouse, making it perfect for a [palm style grip](https://www.epicgear.com/en/technologies/types-of-mouse-grip){: target="_blank"}. 

In addition to the programmable buttons on the side of the mouse, the DeathAdder Elite features two additional buttons located right below the scroll wheel. They are discrete but easy to access with your finger during gameplay. 

The DeathAdder Elite contains Razer’s Synapse 2.0 software. The Synapse software is used to manage buttons, button profiles, customize RGB lighting, and manage settings such as the DPI.

This mouse is great for League of Legends, but it can also be employed for use in FPS games, [battle royale games](/gaming-mouse/fortnite/), and more. It’s an all-around mouse from a reputable company.

## [Best Razer Mouse for League of Legends: Razer Naga Hex V2](https://amzn.to/2JWNgVN){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2JWNgVN"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Naga Hex V2" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-naga-hex-v2.jpg" /></a>

The Razer Naga Hex V2 is the second version of the Naga Hex. It utilizes a laser sensor and a wired connection to minimize input delay. This 1000Hz mouse has a maximum DPI of 16,000. 

The mouse also has 14 programmable buttons – although this may seem overwhelming, the design of the mouse makes the buttons easy to use. Furthermore, having 14 programmable buttons is ideal for [MOBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena){: target="_blank"} games such as League of Legends

There are seven buttons by the thumb. On top of the mouse, you have the typical left and right click buttons along with the scroll wheel. There is a DPI button located below the scroll wheel as well. 

While this mouse is not the most aesthetically pleasing, it makes up for it in gameplay. This mouse has a raise on top instead of on the side, along with an elevated palm rest. To my surprise, I found this mouse quite comfortable during gameplay.

The Naga Hex V2 also contains the Synapse Software which can be used to customize your experience.

The lighting in the Hex V2 is also highly customizable. There are three separate zones, all of which can glow in unison, or separated to illuminate three different colors. 

Overall, this mouse is best used best for MOBA gameplay. The buttons on the side can take a little getting used to, but the mouse surely gets the job done after a little bit of adjustment.

## [BenQ ZOWIE FK1 E-Sports Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2AbiwAT){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2AbiwAT"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="BenQ ZOWIE FK1 E-Sports Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/zowie-fk1.jpg" /></a>

The BenQ ZOWIE FK1 has a simple and straightforward design. It is relatively light and uses the Avago 3310 optical sensor. 

It has an adjustable DPI sensor – you can choose from 400, 800, 1600, and  3200 DPI. The mouse is ambidextrous, with thumb buttons on both the left and right side. If you're looking for an awesome [left handed gaming mouse](/gaming-mouse/left-handed/), this is the one for you! 

It is a “plug and play” mouse, meaning it doesn’t require any drivers for setup. This is especially good news if you want to hop right into the action!

This mouse has an adjustable USB report rate of 125, 500, and 1000Hz. 

The ZOWIE FK1 is employed not only for League of Legends gamers but professional FPS gamers as well. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players love this mouse. 

A true MOBA mouse for League should have plenty of programmable buttons. This mouse only has four, but it’s one of the best mice on the market. I’d recommend this mouse to anyone looking to play a mix of League of Legends, and other games too.

## [Best Wireless Mouse for League of Legends: Logitech G903](https://amzn.to/2LLw87c){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LLw87c"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="Logitech G903" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/logitech-g903.png" /></a>

If you don't want to deal with a corded gaming mouse, I'd highly recommend the [Logitech G903](https://amzn.to/2LLw87c){: target="_blank"}. It's a wireless mouse that uses the PMW3366 optical sensor, with a maximum DPI of 12,000.

Unlike a wired mouse, you'll have to replace the battery every so often (about every 32 hours, without RGB lighting.) 

It has 11 programmable buttons, which is perfect for a MOBA like League of Legends. It's one of the most ergonomic mice I've ever used, and has an amazing 'click feel.' The clicks sound crisp, too. 

It has a metal scroll wheel that can click and spin freely for 15 seconds. The scroll is also notched, which is good for switching weapons in FPS shooters. 

It is more expensive than most wired gaming mice, but it's a price you'll have to pay for a good wireless mouse. 

The mouse is ambidextrous, so both right handed and left handed users can use it. 

It is also extremely lightweight, weighing in at just 107 grams. Overall, it's easily one of the best wireless gaming mice on the market today.

## Things to Keep in Mind

**Ergonomics:** This is easily one of the most important things to consider if you're buying a gaming mouse. Whether you're playing League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Battlefield or PUBG, you need a comfortable mouse. If you intend on gaming for hours on end, your hand will cramp if your mouse is not ergonomic. 

**Grip Type:** There are many different grip styles, and each grip has a mouse design best suited for it. For example, a big mouse is best for a palm grip, whereas a smaller and lighter mouse is best suited for a claw grip.

**Sensitivity:** Sensitivity is obviously important, but it is highly dependent on the person and the game you're playing. I prefer a lower sensitivity because I play FPS games like CS:GO. I like being able to track the head of my opponents, and I use a palm grip, so a slower sensitivity works best for me. If you prefer the claw grip or finger tip grip, you'll need a higher sensitivity. With a higher sensitivity, you'll have faster reaction times, and less accuracy. 

![Mouse in Action](/img/lol-gaming-mouse/in-action.jpg)

**Wireless or Wired:** This one is completely based on personal preference. Each options has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Wired mice are convenient in that they don't run out of battery and have a fast response time, but you can only use the mouse where the cable can reach, and the wire can become tangled. On the flip side, a wireless mouse is not restricted by a cable, but the batteries can die during gameplay, and response times are generally slower. 

**Programmable Buttons:** Unlike common computer mice, a gaming mouse has additional buttons, usually referred to as macros. Choose a mouse with as many or as little buttons as you need for your preferred genre of game. I'd recommend a mouse with plenty of programmable buttons for League of Legends. 

**Budget:** You'll find mice that vary in price, due to a difference in features, retailers, and performance. Think about what features you want, and the quality you're looking for. Both of these factors will determine how much you should be spending. (By the way, you can't go wrong with any of the mice listed above!)

## Types of Mouse Grips

**Palm Grip:** The palm grip is probably the most popular grip style, because it feels relaxed and natural. Bigger mice are ideal for the palm grip, especially those with a steeper back arch for hand support. 

Mice that are suited for the palm grip usually suffer from mobility and agility issues, and are often times ill suited for games that demand many rapid mouse movements. 

The palm grip is ergonomic and comfortable, but is the least accurate. If you're an FPS or MOBA gamer, this grip may not be the best for you. 

**Claw Grip:** The claw grip is popular among RTS and FPS gamers. This style of grip may seem awkward, but it allows for incredibly precise mouse movements. 

In games that require an incredibly high level of accuracy, this grip is ideal. The hand is arched up with less contact points on the mouse, forming a claw shape. 

Mice made for the claw grip are usually smaller, lighter, and agile. In addition, you'll want a higher sensitivity for this grip style. 

**Fingertip Grip:** This grip is the least common of the three. In order to perform the fingertip grip, the only contact points on the mouse are your fingertips. 

You use the tips of your fingers to direct the motion of the mouse's rapid movements. Short, light, and agile mice are best suited for this type of grip.

The fingertip grip is designed for speed. You're definitely going to want to turn up your sensitivity for this grip style.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

I've been receiving many of the same questions with regards to LOL gaming mice, so I'm making this section to answer the most common ones I receive. 

**How much should I spend on a mouse for League of Legends?** There is no set amount that you have to spend on a gaming mouse for League of Legends. Of course, if you spend more, odds are you're going to get a product of higher quality. Any of the options on this list are great, so choose the one that is best suited for your needs and budget. 

**How many macros do you need for a League of Legends gaming mouse?** I've only played a few rounds of League myself, so it's safe to say I'm a bit of a noob. However, other serious players that I know have told me they like to have a lot of macros on their mouse. That's why I chose mice with plenty of macros for this list! 

**Should I buy a wired or wireless mouse?** I've been using the Razer DeathAdder for years now, which is a wired mouse. I've never had any issues with it, nor do I desire buying a wireless mouse in the future. I never have to worry about replacing a battery, and the connection from my mouse to my computer is faster than a wireless connection. On the other hand, the difference between a wired/wireless mouse is negligible for the most part, so it comes down to a matter of preference.
