## [LINGYI Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2MCmjMI){: target="_blank"} - $9
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MCmjMI"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="lingyi gaming mouse" src="/img/mouse/lingyi-gaming-mouse.jpg" /></a>

The [LINGYI Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2MCmjMI){: target="_blank"} is a big and flashy gaming mouse. It's a bit over the top in my opinion, but it's incredibly comfortable to hold and easy to use. 

Best of all? 

This gaming mouse is dirt cheap! Simply plug in the mouse and you can adjust its lighting and DPI settings. The mouse's DPI starts at 1200 an goes up from there, which is pretty high – on the other hand, you can't ask for much more from an $8 gaming mouse. 

It isn't the best mouse on the market, but it definitely offers a great bang for your buck, especially if you are on a tight budget. 

## [Best Cheap Wired Gaming Mouse: Logitech G300s](https://amzn.to/2Plqdb7){: target="_blank"} - $20
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Plqdb7"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Logitech G300s" src="/img/mouse/logitech-g300s.png" /></a>

The [Logitech G300s](https://amzn.to/2Plqdb7){: target="_blank"} is not cheaply made – it's actually an awesome mouse. It's sporting a durable build, a responsive and accurate sensor, not to mention an incredibly ergonomic grip. 

So, why is this mouse dirt cheap? 

It's an old mouse. Don't worry – an old mouse from Logitech is still superior to a new knockoff brand any day of the week. 

It has an ambidextrous design, color backlighting, and six programmable macro buttons with three unique button profiles. 

The mouse also has totally accurate [DPI](http://xahlee.info/kbd/mouse_dpi.html){: target="_blank"} levels, which you can program yourself with Logitech's unique software.

In all honesty, this mouse is a steal for a mere $20. 

## [Corsair Harpoon RGB](https://amzn.to/2OLNAJV){: target="_blank"} - $28
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2OLNAJV"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="corsair harpoon rgb" src="/img/mouse/corsair-harpoon-rgb.png" /></a>

For less than $30, the [Corsair Harpoon RGB](https://amzn.to/2OLNAJV){: target="_blank"} is one heck of a mouse. 

It doesn't offer any spectacular or fancy features, but from a functionality standpoint, this cheap gaming mouse does it all. 

It has a great size and design. For example, the sides of the mouse have a grippy rubber texture to avoid slippage during gameplay. 

Moreover, its sensor is accurate, and the mouse is comfortable even after prolonged use. The mouse has forward and back buttons on the left-side, and a convenient DPI switch below the mouse wheel. 

The mouse even has an incredibly high maximum DPI of 16,000, which will surely suit your needs. 

This mouse is our top pick if you have $30 to spare. 

## [SteelSeries Sensei 310](https://amzn.to/2L9sSkW){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2L9sSkW"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="steelseries sensei 310" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/steelseries-sensei-310.png" /></a>

The [SteelSeries Sensei 310](https://amzn.to/2L9sSkW){: target="_blank"} is an ambidextrous gaming mouse, which means it can be used by [left handed](/gaming-mouse/left-handed/) gamers. 

Moreover, it's one of the most ergonomic gaming mice on the market. It's a bit more expensive than the first few mice on this list, but I can assure you that it is well worth the investment. 

The mouse features a low-profile design that is well suited for the [palm grip](https://www.epicgear.com/en/technologies/types-of-mouse-grip){: target="_blank"}. 

The mouse also has several programmable macro buttons and textured hand grips on either side. 

It has a high quality and accurate sensor that will ensure every move you make is on target. 

Lastly, SteelSeries’ Engine software lets you personalize everything from LED lighting to DPI. 

I’m right handed, but I loved this ambidextrous mouse. It’s great choice for any gamer!

## [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2Lase6E){: target="_blank"} - $50
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lase6E"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer DeathAdder Elite" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-deathadder-elite.jpg" /></a>

The [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2Lase6E){: target="_blank"} is the priciest mouse on this list, but for good reason. 

It's comfortable, durable, accurate, and easy to use. I've tested plenty of different mice in my day, but this one is my favorite. 

In fact, it's been my personal mouse for the past few years, without any complaint. 

I can assure you that this mouse is incredibly comfortable, even after being used for a long time. It's a bigger mouse, so it's especially well suited for those who use a palm grip. 

Similar to the original DeathAdder, the DeathAdder Elite is only different in that it has extra programmable buttons, which I've always enjoyed. 

Overall, this mouse is an excellent choice if you have the money in your budget.

## Cheap Gaming Mouse Buying Guide 

If you're new to the PC gaming community, or you just don't know what to look for in a gaming mouse, I've got your back. Be sure to consider the following before buying: 

* **DPI:** DPI stands for dots per inch, and it measures mouse sensitivity. Adjusting your DPI will affect the speed of your mouse movement.  

* **Programmable Buttons:** Almost all gaming mice have at least a few programmable buttons, known as macros. Most gamers prefer their mouse to have several macros, as they are often incredibly convenient. Instead of having to reach your hand across the keyboard, you can have all of your important controls right at the tip of your thumb. 

* **Polling Rate:** Polling rate is how long it takes for the input from your mouse to reach your computer, and how quickly your computer will update your inputs. If you're buying a gaming mouse, it's important your mouse has a high polling rate, especially if you're a competitive gamer. Try to find a mouse with a polling rate of at least 1,000 Hertz.  

![Mouse cover](/img/mouse/mouse-cover.jpg)

* **Sensor:** All mice – gaming mice included – use a sensor to track movement. The sensor is either an [optical](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/question631.htm){: target="_blank"} sensor or a [laser](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/optical-vs-laser-mouse-explanation/){: target="_blank"} sensor. Optical sensors are slightly less precise than laser sensors. However, they're also cheaper. In my opinion, the difference is negligible, but if you're an incredibly competitive gamer or you play FPS games which require accurate shots, go for a laser sensor. 

* **Acceleration:** Mouse acceleration is evil. If you have it enabled, please, I'm begging you, turn it off. For those of you who don't know, mouse acceleration destroys your aim. If you move your mouse one inch, and you do it slowly, your cursor won't move very far. If you move your mouse one more inch, but you do it rapidly, your cursor will move farther. This is awful for your aim, because when you need to snap from target to target, your cursor will move a different amount even when you move the mouse the same distance. It's impossible to develop muscle memory like this which is important for aim. Moral of the story, don't buy a mouse that has mouse acceleration, and if you can, turn it off.
