<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MCmjMI"><img class="img-small img-right" alt="lingyi gaming mouse" src="/img/mouse/lingyi-gaming-mouse.jpg" /></a>

The [LINGYI Gaming Mouse](https://amzn.to/2MCmjMI){: target="_blank"} is a big and flashy gaming mouse. It's a bit over the top in my opinion, but it's incredibly comfortable to hold and easy to use. 

Best of all? 

This gaming mouse is dirt cheap! Simply plug in the mouse and you can adjust its lighting and DPI settings. The mouse's DPI starts at 1200 an goes up from there, which is pretty high – on the other hand, you can't ask for much more from an $8 gaming mouse. 

It isn't the best mouse on the market, but it definitely offers a great bang for your buck, especially if you are on a tight budget. 

## [Best Cheap Wired Gaming Mouse: Logitech G300s](https://amzn.to/2Plqdb7){: target="_blank"} - $20

So, why is this mouse so cheap? 

It's an old mouse. Don't worry – an old mouse from Logitech is still superior to a new knockoff brand any day of the week. 

It has an ambidextrous design, color backlighting, and six programmable macro buttons with three unique button profiles. 

The mouse also has totally accurate DPI levels, which you can program yourself with Logitech's unique software.

In all honesty, this mouse is a steal for a mere $20.

It doesn't offer any spectacular or fancy features, but from a functionality standpoint, this cheap gaming mouse does it all.

Moreover, its sensor is accurate, and the mouse is comfortable even after prolonged use. The mouse has forward and back buttons on the left-side, and a convenient DPI switch below the mouse wheel. 

The mouse even has an incredibly high maximum DPI of 16,000, which will surely suit your needs.

Moreover, it's one of the most ergonomic gaming mice on the market. It's a bit more expensive than the first few mice on this list, but I can assure you that it is well worth the investment. 

The mouse features a low-profile design that is well suited for the [palm grip](https://www.epicgear.com/en/technologies/types-of-mouse-grip){: target="_blank"}. 

The mouse also has several programmable macro buttons and textured hand grips on either side. 

It has a high quality and accurate sensor that will ensure every move you make is on target.
