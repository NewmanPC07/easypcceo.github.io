## [Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2LD7IQF){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LD7IQF"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/logitech-g502-proteus-spectrum.png" /></a>

The [Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2LD7IQF){: target="_blank"} is easily one of the best gaming mice on the market, and probably the best mouse for Fortnite, too. 

Logitech's G502 is entirely tunable and customizable, and features 11 programmable buttons. The extra buttons are incredibly helpful for Fortnite, as you can bind many different controls to them. 

For example, you can place walls, ramps, floors, and traps all with the mouse's programmable macros, rather than having to stretch your left hand across your keyboard. 

Building in Fortnite is an important skill to master if you want to learn, and this mouse is going to help you out tremendously. 

The mouse is optimized for both claw and palm grips, and has a ridged scroll wheel which is perfect for changing weapons. It even has a dedicated "sniper" button for aiming, and interchangeable weights that can be used to customize the mouse's bulk. 

You even have the option of customizing the mouse's RGB lighting. 

As far as accuracy and gaming performance is concerned, this mouse is spot on. The mouse's sensor is excellent, movement is fluid and precise – overall, it's an amazing mouse for the money, which is why it's earned our #1 spot on this list. 

## [Razer Basilisk](https://amzn.to/2LU81TO){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LU81TO"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Basilisk" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/razer-basilisk.jpg" /></a>

The [Razer Basilisk](https://amzn.to/2LU81TO){: target="_blank"} is an excellent FPS mouse – it also happens to be great for third-person shooters like Fortnite as well. 

This wonderfully designed, streamlined mouse has a few extra features that bring it up a notch from other mice in its weight class. 

It has two programmable thumb buttons and two face buttons. Moreover, the sensor is precise and accurate, which is crucial for a Fortnite mouse. 

The sensor has a wide variety of DPI settings, and an adjustable-length "clutch," which activates a lower DPI "sniper" mode. 

I particularly like the [ergonomics](https://www.ergonomics.com.au/what-is-ergonomics/){: target="_blank"} of the mouse. I used it during a several hour long Fortnite session. 

Even after hours of gameplay and a few awesome Victory Royales, my hand wasn't uncomfortable or cramping. 

## [Best Wireless Fortnite Mouse: Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2Oljo97){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Oljo97"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Logitech g900 chaos spectrum" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/logitech-g900-chaos-spectrum.png" /></a>

If you have a distaste for wired mice, I decided to include a wireless Fortnite mouse on this list. 

The [Logitech G900 Chaos Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2Oljo97){: target="_blank"} is an excellent choice when it comes to wireless gaming mice for shooters like Fortnite. 

Based on my testing, the G900 is just as responsive and reliable as any of its wired competition. Battery life isn't an issue either. 

The mouse's sensor is accurate. I won the first match I played with the mouse, and I was surprised by my ability to get used to it so quickly. Using the mouse feels intuitive. 

You can customize the side of the mouse depending on whether you are right handed or left handed. You can even decide whether you want two programmable thumb buttons, or not. 

## [Razer Naga Trinity](https://amzn.to/2LJGLL1){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LJGLL1"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="razer naga trinity" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/razer-naga-trinity.jpg" /></a>

Unlike other shooters, you need a considerably high level of skill to play. Your shots must be accurate – and more importantly – you must be able to build well. 

If you'd prefer having access to all of the controls you need at the tip of your thumb, rather than having to reach across a keyboard, this mouse is the one for you. 

The mouse has interchangeable side panels, you can have the option of twelve, seven, or just two thumb buttons. The choice of macro buttons is awesome for Fortnite, especially when you're in the middle of an intense build fight. 

What's the bottom line here?

This mouse is ergonomic, accurate, durable, and has all of the controls you need at the tip of your thumb. 

## [Best Left Handed Fortnite Mouse: SteelSeries Sensei 310](https://amzn.to/2mQ6iEi){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2mQ6iEi"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="steelseries sensei 310" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/steelseries-sensei-310.png" /></a>

If you're left handed, you may feel like you're at a disadvantage. Luckily for you, SteelSeries has an excellent left handed mouse option that can dominate in Fortnite. 

The [SteelSeries Sensei 310](https://amzn.to/2mQ6iEi){: target="_blank"} is one of the few gaming mice on the market that's just as good in both your right or left hand. 

The mouse features a low-profile design that caters to the palm grip especially well. It has several programmable macros, and textured hand rests on both sides of the mouse. 

Its high quality motion sensor ensures every shot you fire is on target. 

Lastly, SteelSeries' Engine software lets you personalize everything from DPI to LED lighting.  

I'm right handed, but I loved this ambidextrous mouse. It's great choice for any gamer, right or left handed! 

## [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Deathadder Elite" src="/img/lol-gaming-mouse/razer-deathadder-elite.jpg" /></a>

The [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2uQ8r7n){: target="_blank"} is my mouse of choice. I've been using it for the past several years, without any complaint. 

Although I don't game too often anymore, I've definitely logged plenty of hours behind my mouse and keyboard.

After many late nights of gaming, I can assure you this mouse is incredibly comfortable, even after hours of use. It is especially good for those of you who like the palm style grip. 

The DeathAdder Elite is similar to the original DeathAdder, but the Elite model has extra macro buttons, rendering it an even better choice for Fortnite. 

The sensor is accurate, the mouse is comfortable, and of high quality, too.

You can customize the lighting options with Razer's Synapse 2.0 software. Overall it's an excellent choice if you're loooking for the best mouse for Fortnite. 

## [Logitech G Pro](https://amzn.to/2NPNKiZ){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NPNKiZ"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="logitech g pro" src="/img/fortnite-mouse/logitech-g-pro.png" /></a>

A more basic version of Logitech's G502 model, the [Logitech G Pro](https://amzn.to/2NPNKiZ){: target="_blank"} is a great budget alternative. 

The mouse's sensor tracks movement well, and its wired connection ensures minimal input delay. 

Comparitively to many of Logitech's popular gaming mice, the Logitech G Pro is capable of 12000 DPI. There is an adjustable DPI button located underneath of the scroll wheel for quick adjustments on the fly. 

The G logo is illuminated by bright and vibrant RGB lighting, with 16.8 million different color options. 

The mouse is well suited for the claw grip, but I had no issues with the palm grip style either. 

The mouse doesn't offer any significant features, but it surely gets the job done for its low price. 

## Things You Should Consider When Buying a New Gaming Mouse

Before you spend your hard earned money on a gaming mouse, you need to consider the following:  

* **DPI:** DPI stands for dots per inch, and it is a common measurement of a mouse's sensitivity. Adjusting your DPI will change the speed of your cursor's movement – and as a consequence – your in-game sensitivity. 

* **Programmable Buttons:** Most gaming mice have several programmable buttons in addition to the traditional left, right, and middle mouse buton. Many gamers – myself included – love having additional controls at the tip of my thumb. Having additional buttons is useful in most titles, Fortnite included. 

* **Polling Rate:** This measures the time it takes for your mouse input to reach your computer, and how often your computer will update your inputs on the screen. It's important that your mouse has a high polling rate. I'd recommend going for a mouse with a polling rate of 1,000Hz. This means your computer will update the cursor's position once every millisecond. 

![Mouse cover](/img/fortnite-mouse/cover.jpg)

* **Sensor:** A gaming mouse employs one of two sensors: an optical sensor, or a laser sensor. Optical sensors are slightly less accurate, but optical mice are usually cheaper. In my experience, the difference isn't really noticeable – however, if you're a professional or competitive gamer, I'd highly recommend going for a laser sensor, as it will give you the edge you need to compete with professionals. 

* **Acceleration:** Mouse acceleration is not a good thing, especially when it comes to gaming. Basically, when you move your mouse very quickly across two inches of your mousepad, the cursor will move farther than if you had moved it two inches, but very slowly. If you're a gamer, you want to develop muscle memory so that you can quickly snap to your target. If you have mouse acceleration on, you won't be able to build up the muscle memory, and your shots will be inaccurate. 

* **Lift Off Distance:** I usually play with a lower sensitivity, as I can more easily track targets. With that being said, often times I have to pick up my mouse to readjust it before I run out of room on the mousepad. If your mouse tracks movement even when it is high off of the mousepad, you'll be all over the place while readjusting the mouse. If you're looking for a gaming mouse, find one with a low lift off distance, so you'll stay on target when readjusting. This is especially important if you prefer a lower sensitivity.

## Fortnite Mouse FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**What grip style is best for Fortnite?** I believe the claw grip is one of the best grip styles for shooters, as players can easily snap from target to target. However, I use a palm grip, as it is the most comfortable for me. Try out different styles until you find one that works best for you! 

**Do I need a lot of programmable buttons?** If you're looking for the best mouse for Fortnite, I'd recommend one with at least a few programmable macros. You can use them to deploy traps, and to lay down walls, ramps, floor panels, etc. In the heat of an intense build fight, having controls at the tip of your thumb is incredibly helpful. 

**Should I buy a wired or wireless mouse?** Several years ago, I'd only recommend a wired mouse, because wireless mice often suffered from input delay. However, these days you can easily find a suitable wireless mouse, with minimal input delay when compared to a wired alternative. 

**Can I use my Fortnite mouse for other games, too?** Of course! The Razer DeathAdder Elite and the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum are both incredibly versatile. You can use them for Fortnite, and virtually any other game you want to play!
