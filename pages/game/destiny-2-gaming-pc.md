![Destiny 2](/img/games/destiny-2/cover.jpg)

Destiny 2's PC launch date is set for October 24. This is nearly two months after its launch on console, September 6. Of course, we're all willing to wait for a better overall PC gaming experience. 

When Destiny 2 was shown on the PC at the reveal event in Los Angeles, everybody was buzzing about the phenomenal graphics. 

It has a lot of people wondering: how much would it cost to play Destiny 2 at 1080p with 60 FPS? 

Less than $700. In fact, we built a gaming PC for $642 that runs the Destiny 2 beta in 1080p with over 100 frames per second. The full release should see even better performance, as it'll be further optimzed. 

The build meets all of the Destiny 2 system requirements on the PC. It'll run Destiny 2 with ease.

Take a look at the build:

## The CPU 
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-small .img-right}


A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate CPU is important. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKWT8J4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XKWT8J4&linkId=54aed5114182dc4ba9178085f844d3f5) is a great budget gaming CPU.

## The Ram
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B250 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

## The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png  "1TB Hard Drive"){: .img-small .img-right}


The [WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&linkId=ebd1ec7b7b862a7d17070d2b1ea21b01) is today's standard mass storage drive for good reason. 

1TB of storage is plenty for your OS, drivers, video games, music, videos, etc. Furthermore, this HDD is known for its reliability and dependibility. 

It is a 7200 RPM hard drive, meaning load times are signficantly quicker than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Unfortunately we were not able to include an SSD in this build. However, you can find SSDs on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=solid+state+drive&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) at a low cost.

## The Power Supply 
![EVGA 400W PSU](/img/PSU/evga 400w.png "EVGA 400W PSU"){: .img-small .img-right}


The reliability of your power supply is important. Furthermore, it is crucial to use a power supply with the proper wattage. 

Why? 

If you fail to do either of these two things, one or both of the following will happen: 

**A)** Your power supply will short out your PC <br>    
**B)** Your power supply will fail completely 

This build is rated at 211 watts. That being said, the EVGA 400W ATX power supply is the choice for this build. 

It has more than enough power, and combined with its $30 price tag, it is an absolute steal.
