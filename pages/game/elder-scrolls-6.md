The Elder Scrolls 6 may feel like it's ages away, but that's probably not the case. We think the new Elder Scrolls game is right around the corner (more or less). The Elder Scrolls has been a fan favorite since its inception. The Elder Scrolls 6 will be no different. 

Though Bethesda is focusing on The Evil Within 2 and Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, it seems that the sequel to Skyrim is in the works. Bethesda tries to deny these claims, though the new title seems inevitable. In the mean time, you can play Elder Scrolls Online on the [PC](http://amzn.to/2AzME7Y), [Xbox One](http://amzn.to/2ApbUeI), or [PS4](http://amzn.to/2jDJVA7). 

## Bethesda is Filling New Positions

As of August 2017, Bethesda had 20 new roles advertised on their site ranging from Quest Designers to Concept Artists. Considering the October release of [Wolfenstein 2](http://amzn.to/2i7VezR) and [The Evil Within 2](http://amzn.to/2njVzVL), it's unlikely these positions were for either of these big titles. We can only hope these positions are for the new Elder Scrolls. 

## A New Setting

Real details about the location of the new Elder Scrolls are few and far between. Some are hard to believe. However, in the Dragonborn DLC to us to the island of Solstheim. The past two Elder Scrolls took us to places ruled mainly by humans. A realm ruled by other creatures is more than possible for the new location. 

No matter where the game takes place, be sure to expect plenty of quests and a whole new atmosphere. 

## The Game has Been Confirmed 

Back in 2016 Bethesda’s Todd Howard told [TeamRock](http://teamrock.com/game/2016-06-23/bethesda-confirms-they-re-working-on-the-elder-scrolls-6) “I think it's good to tell our fans in these moments, yes, of course we are making Elder Scrolls 6. It's something we love. But it is — I have to be careful what I say — it's a very long way off. I could sit here and explain the game to you, and you would say, 'That sounds like you don't even have the technology — how long is that going to take?' And so it's something that's going to take a lot of time, what we have in mind for that game”. 

Howard definitely has some big plans for the next step in the series. [Games Radar](http://www.gamesradar.com) speculates that Elder Scrolls 6 may feature settlement building as we saw with Fallout 4. On the other hand, Bethesda might have something new in store. 

## The Elder Scrolls 6 Will Look Absolutely Gorgeous

Based on Howard's comments, it seems the new edition to the series is very technologcially advanced. With advancements made every day, the look and feel of this game will be better than ever before. 

While the game will be okay on the [Xbox One](http://amzn.to/2ia3iAp) and the [PS4](http://amzn.to/2nlsfyh), the game will truly look its best on a gaming PC. [You can view budget gaming PC builds here](/budget-pcs/).

With a gaming PC you can play the Elder Scrolls 6 in stunning 1080p, 1440p or even 4K resolution with ultra qualtiy and high framerates. In our opinion there is no other way to game. 

## The Elder Scrolls 6 is in a Land Far, Far Away 

Bethesda seems to announce games when they're close to release. It's not a shock that we haven't heard anything from them officially regarding Elder Scrolls 6. 

Hopefully we'll hear something official from Bethesda in 2018 with a release date in 2019. 

## The Game is Well Worth the Wait

Though The Elder Scrolls 6 may be a ways away, it might not be such a bad thing. 

Hopefully we're going to see some major improvements to the franchise. First of all, a new environment wouldn't be all that bad. Most people are probably tired of traversing the same snowy mountains and encampments. 

In addition, a change in the combat system would be awesome. Don't get us wrong, we love slaying dragons and slashing enemies until they drop. However, combat seems to be just that: button smashing until the enemy is dead. In the new title, we'd like to see a more dynamic combat system. 

Lastly, we're excited for better AI. Have you ever had someone staring at you all fine and dandy after you murdered their spouse? We want there to be consequences for your actions. [Trusted Reviews](http://www.trustedreviews.com) mentioned they'd like to see some sort of hero/villain system in place. The townspeople will fear you as you murder beggers or praise you with gifts after accomplishing another heroic deed. 

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, no matter what Elder Scrolls 6 has in store for us, we're excited. We can't count how many hours we've spent traversing the wonderful world of Skyrim, and we can't wait to see what the next title has in store. 

If you want to play the new Elder Scrolls title with the best graphics and framerates for our [gaming PC builds](/budget-pcs/). The best gaming experience is behind a mouse and keyboard.
