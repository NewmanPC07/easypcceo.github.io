## [Google Pixel C 10.2-in HD 64GB Tablet](https://amzn.to/2Lm0aRW){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lm0aRW"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Razer Tartarus Chroma Expert RGB Gaming Keypad" src="/img/gaming-tablet/google-pixel-c.png" /></a>

The [Google Pixel C](https://amzn.to/2Lm0aRW){: target="_blank"} is a 10.2-inch Android tablet, equipped with a 2560 x 1800 display. 

The device's build quality is premium, and bridges the gap between Google's Chromebooks and Nexus's slates. 

You can purchase a keyboard dock for the tablet, which transforms the Pixel C into a hybrid laptop. 

The device's design is minimalistic, yet elegant. The tablet weighs in at 500g, which is as light as a feather. Unlike other tablets, the Pixel C does not have a physical home button.

The device has a Type C USB port, a power/sleep button, and volume rockers on its bezel. 

The Type C port on the tablet can be used to charge other mobile devices. The tablet has impeccable sound quality, thanks to its dual stereo speakers on either side of it. If you want to plug in some headphones, the tablet also has a 3.5mm headphone jack. 

If you like taking pictures, you'll enjoy the Google Pixel C's 8MP camera. I was pleased with the tablet's camera quality, but I wasn't blown away. 

The Pixel C has a Tegra X1 64-bit quad-core processor, 3GB of dedicated RAM and a Maxwell GPU. Games load quickly and gameplay is smooth. Overall, it's a great gaming experience. 

The battery lasts for around 10 hours according to Google, but that is heavily dependent on how much you use the tablet, and what you're doing with it. 

The price of this tablet is obviously its biggest downside. Keep in mind, however, that this tablet is capable of far more than merely gaming. 

Sure, you can game with it – you can also use it as a hybrid laptop with the attachable keyboard. If you have the money to spend, it is well worth the investment. 

## [Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch 64GB Tablet ](https://amzn.to/2Nxo2PV){: target="_blank"}
<td><a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Nxo2PV"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Apple iPad Pro" src="/img/gaming-tablet/apple-ipad-pro.png" /></a>

I decided to include one Apple product on this list in case you prefer IOS devices. 

If you're going to go the IOS route, the [Apple iPad Pro 10.5-inch 64GB Tablet ](https://amzn.to/2Nxo2PV){: target="_blank"} is a fantastic choice. It's especially good for light gaming, combining the power of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the thin frame of the iPad Air. 

When this tablet was created, gaming was not on the top of their list of priorities. However, the iPad Pro is more than capable of light gaming. Moreover, it's a great tablet for doing, well, just about anything you'd do with a tablet. 

Apple devices are well known for their reliability, because Apple optimizes their devices to run perfectly with Apple software. 

In addition, the iPad Pro is equipped with a 2.16 GHz processor and 2GB of RAM – to top that off, the best part of the device is arguably its 264ppi pixel density display.

This tablet also has a fantastic camera. If you're interested in taking high quality pictures, this tablet is fit for the task. 

The iPad Pro is an all around great product – boasting a long lasting battery, beautiful display, great camera, and awesome gaming performance. You can even connect a keyboard to the tablet, transforming it into a makeshift laptop. 

## [NVIDIA Shield K1 8" Tablet](https://amzn.to/2O5QWI7){: target="_blank"}
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2O5QWI7"><img class="img-right img-small" alt="Apple iPad Pro" src="/img/gaming-tablet/nvidia-k1-tablet.png" /></a>

NVIDIA is a GPU manufacturing company – with that being said, it's safe to say they know how to design a gaming tablet. 

The [NVIDIA Shield K1 8" tablet](https://amzn.to/2O5QWI7){: target="_blank"} was created specifically with gaming in mind. It is one of the best gaming tablets on the market.

Featuring an 8-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display, it runs games with stunning visuals. It has speakers on the top and bottom of the tablet, which emit immserive sound.

The tablet also has a 5-megapixel camera – although the K1's camera doesn't rival that of the iPad Pro, it is still decent. Besides, your main concern is probably gaming performance, not photography. 

You can connect the tablet to a TV via the tablet's mini HDMI port. The tablet can be magnetically attached to a folding cover stand. On the right side, you'll find the power button, volume controls, and a microSD slot (with a maximum capacity of 200GB).


The K1 when out of the box runs a stock build of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Of the 16GB of internal storage, 11.24GB is available out of the box. Buying the device also gives you an option to join GeForce Now(billed monthly)Nvidia’s cloud service that streams popular PC games to the tablet. The app allows you to stream games at 1080p at up to 60 frames per second and can certainly give you a much better experience than what stock Android has to offer.

Performance of the device is outstanding as the device is powered by an ARM Cortex A15 CPU that clocks in at 2.2GHz, along with Nvidia’s own Tegra K1 192-core Kepler GPU and 2GB of RAM   The K1 offers a lot more than what most tablets had to offer back when it was released. The device can also be connected to a TV and used along with a Shield controller to give you a much better gaming experience. The device’s camera offers pretty decent picture clarity and can be used to point and shoot when on the go. The K1 is packed with a 5,200 mAh battery and promises up to 6 hours of back up (this can vary depending on usage)

If you are looking for something that delivers quality and performance and doesn’t mind how old it is then the K1 might be a good device for you. Back when the device was launched it was one of the best of its kind and had a lot to offer. Overall if you don’t mind the Android interface and you just want a dedicated device to satisfy your gaming needs on the go then the K1 should be considered.
