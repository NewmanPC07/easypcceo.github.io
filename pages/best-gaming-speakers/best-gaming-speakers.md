![Yamaha NS-NSP1800BL](/img/gaming-speakers/yamaha-ns.png){: .img-middle}

**6.** is a great speaker setup and for the low cost of just $150, you won't find a better deal. 5.1 channel surround sound with 2 front and back speakers. You even get a center speaker and a large subwoofer. 

Unfortunately this speaker system requires a sound amplifier for optimal sound as it's a standalone 5.1 channel package. 

However, having heard the sound quality of this system, I'd say it's well worth the money. 

## Our Opinion on Gaming Speakers 

If you're serious about gaming, we highly recommend investing in a high quality sound system for gaming. 

Whether you're gaming on the PC or console, good sound quality is important. If you can't hear your opponent, they'll have the upper hand on you. Furthermore, having great surround sound and powerful base really throws you into the action. 

It is our opinion that a great gaming speaker is a must for all serious gamers out there. Even when you're watching TV/movies, a good surround sound speaker system makes it that much beter.
