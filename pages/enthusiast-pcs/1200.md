### The Processor 
![Ryzen 5 1600X](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-right .img-medium}

In nearly all of my budget builds, I recommend a processor that is just fast enough to get the job done. In other words, a lower end processor that can keep up with the GPU. 

At the end of the day, this is all that is necessary. Any well optimized PC game will primarily utilize the power of the GPU. 

What does this mean? 

Well, it means you don't NEED the fastest CPU on the market for PC gaming. Only a few games heavily depend on the CPU. 

However, a gaming PC is more than just a gaming machine. It is a PC that is capable of much more than just gaming. Some tasks require more CPU power. Furthermore, on a budget like this, having a good CPU is expected. 

When you spend $1000 on a gaming PC, you should experience optimal performance at all times. The [Ryzen 5 1600X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XNRQHG4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XNRQHG4&linkId=19e6fe382563cfb3c11b74d1f8ade825) will help to ensure optimal performance.

The Ryzen 5 1600X is an absolute monster. It has 6 cores and 12 threads, making it perfect not only for gaming, but other workstation tasks as well. 

It's new from AMD, and it blows Intel i5 CPUs out of the water. It's perfect for gaming, editing, streaming, etc. 

The 1600X model allows for overclocking as well, further increasing the CPUs power. 

Its base frequency is 3.6 GHz, which is the max turbo frequency of its little brother, the 1600.  

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.6 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 4.0 GHz
* Cores: 6
* Lithograpgy: 14 nm 
* TDP: 95 Watts
* Includes CPU Cooler: No
* Simultaneous Multithreading: Yes

### The CPU Cooler 

There are many different makes and models of CPU coolers on the market today. Fan cooling, water cooling, etc. 

For this build, the [Cooler Master - Hyper 212 EVO 82.9 CFM Sleeve BEaring CPU Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXI/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B005O65JXI&linkId=4493346d4280146868005973210f3001) was chosen. It is one of the most popular coolers out there, and for good reason. 

It is reliable, and effective. For $30, there isn't a better option. 

Specs: 

* Bearing Type: Sleeve
* Noise Level: 9.0 - 36.0 dbA
* Fan RPM: 600 - 2000 RPM
* Height: 6.26"

### The Motherboard
![MSI - B350 Tomahawk ATX AM4 Motherboard](/img/mobo/msi-b350-tomahawk.png "MSI - B350 Tomahawk ATX AM4 Motherboard"){: .img-medium .img-right}

The [MSI - B350 Tomahawk ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVFFXXL/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06WVFFXXL&linkId=4ebad09d2b1bfa708cd66005a44a07c4) was chosen for this build. 

The motherboard BIOS is great and easy to use. It has an AMD B350 chipset, and supports up to 64GB of ram. 

This board has all of the features the build needs, all with a low price tag. 

When the CPU cache is used up, it draws information from the build's ram. After all, ram stands for "Random Access Memory".

This motherboard supports 2400 MHz ram which I sport in all of my builds. This actually increases the CPU performance in CPU intensive tasks. 

Specs: 

* Form Factor: ATX
* CPU Socket: AM4
* Chipset: AMD B350
* Memory Slots: 2 x 288-pin DIMM
* DDR4-1866/2133/2400/2666/2933/3200
* Maximum Supported Memory: 64GB
* Crossfire/SLI Support: Crossfire
* Sata 6 GB/s: 4
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps
* Onboard USB 3.0 Header(s): Yes

### The Ram
![2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x8.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x8GB"){: .img-medium .img-right}


Though some games still really only need 8GB of ram, 16GB is being recommended for many newer titles. Pretty soon, 16GB of ram will be mainstream. 

Since this is an enthusiast build, we tried to "futureproof" the build. 

[2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013J7T5K6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013J7T5K6&linkId=c9c90987a892dc655f57b6ef465af49f) was chosen for the build. 16GB of ram is always nice to have.  

Most games don't utilize more than 8GB of ram. However, some newer games are recommending the use of 12GB and even 16GB of ram. With such a high end build, 16GB is a must. 

Specs: 

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* 16GB (2 x 8GB)
* CAS Latency: 15
* Voltage: 1.2V
* Heat Spreader: Yes
* ECC: No
* Registered: No

### The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue 1TB Hard Drive](/img/hdd/1tb.png "1TB Caviar Blue HDD"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The name WD Caviar Blue carries many attributes with it: 

* Mass Storage
* Reliability
* Simplicity
* Speed

These are just a few of the many benefits of owning a WD Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM internal hard drive. 

Not only is this hard drive fast, it is reliable, and cost effective. 

Unfortunately as mentioned earlier, an SSD was not in the budget. However, [you can easily purchase one in addition to the build.](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=SSD&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)

### The Solid State Drive
![PNY CS1311 120GB SSD](/img/hdd/pny-cs1311.png "PNY CS1311 120GB SSD"){: .img-medium .img-right}


In most builds, I skip the SSD and use the money for a more important part like the graphics card. 

The SSD has no impact on FPS or graphical settings. However, a SSD does significantly increase boot speeds and loading times. 

It's always nice to have an SSD, and in a build like this, it could not be left out. 

For this build, the [PNY - CS1311 120GB 2.5" Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019H3B3P6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B019H3B3P6&linkId=77be3f485e80ccfa4722ebf0495640ae) was chosen. This SSD doesn't have a ton of storage, but it's more than enough for your OS, drivers, and some of your favorite games. 

Specs: 

* Capacity: 120GB
* Interface: Sata 6 Gb/s
* Form Factor: 2.5" 

### The Graphics Card
![Gigabyte - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB WINDFORCE OC Graphics Card](/img/gpu/gtx-1080-windforce.png "Gigabyte - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB WINDFORCE OC Graphics Card"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The graphics card is easily the most important part of any gaming PC. Any well optimized PC game will mainly utilize the power of the GPU. 

GPUs are used for more than just gaming. In fact, they are also the biggest tool in a [miner's](/crypto-mining/) toolbelt. 

The GPU chosen for this build is the [Gigabyte - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB WINDFORCE OC Graphics Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IR6LMLO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IR6LMLO&linkId=c93a6ab97f17801c6e326046dc43793a). This GPU is among the best, if not the best gaming GPUs on the market. Furthermore, it's a [great ethereum miner.](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) 

Due to [ethereum mining](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) the price of this GPU has skyrocketed. Still, it's an excellent GPU and will achieve the highest possible framerates with excellent resolutions and graphical settings. 

With this build, you'll have over 100 FPS in nearly ALL new titles with 1080p resolution and ultra settings.

### The Power Supply 
![Corsair CXM 650W](/img/PSU/corsair-cxm-650w.png "Corsair CXM 650W PSU"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The [Corsair - CXM 650W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi Modular ATX power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B72W1VA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01B72W1VA&linkId=8d55f3d642ba43f887e8f88ef0fa926f) was chosen for the build. 

It's semi modular, which helps keep the cables nice and tidy, as well as improve airflow within the case. 

The build draws 400W, but overclocking is intended with this build. After overclocking the CPU and GPU, 650W is more than enough. 

Specs: 

* Manufacturer: Corsair
* Model: CX650M 
* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 650 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
* Efficiency Certification: 80+ Bronze
