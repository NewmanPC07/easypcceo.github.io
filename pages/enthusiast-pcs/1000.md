### The Case 
![Fractal Design Focus G (White)](/img/case/fractaldesign-focusg.jpg "Fractal Design Focus G (White)"){: .img-right .img-medium}


A good case is so much more than a box for your PC. It must have good airflow, cable management, USB 3.0 headers, space for case fans, and last but not least, it should look good. 

With these factors in mind, the [Fractal Design - Fcous G (Black) ATX mid tower case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071SHFRTP/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B071SHFRTP&linkId=5592028d23d8e6ed2ca7fe3dba505ae3) was chosen for this build. 

It features a nice side panel window allowing you to view the rest of your PC in action. Furthermore, it has great cable management and plenty of case fans. All in all, it's a great choice for the build and the budget.

### The Processor 
![Ryzen 5 1600](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-right .img-medium}

In nearly all of my budget builds, I recommend a processor that is just fast enough to get the job done. In other words, a lower end processor that can keep up with the GPU. 

At the end of the day, this is all that is necessary. Any well optimized PC game will primarily utilize the power of the GPU. 

What does this mean? 

Well, it means you don't NEED the fastest CPU on the market for PC gaming. Only a few games heavily depend on the CPU. 

However, a gaming PC is more than just a gaming machine. It is a PC that is capable of much more than just gaming. Some tasks require more CPU power. Furthermore, on a budget like this, having a good CPU is beneficial. 

When you spend $1000 on a gaming PC, you should experience optimal performance at all times. The [Ryzen 5 1600](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XNRQHG4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06XNRQHG4&linkId=19e6fe382563cfb3c11b74d1f8ade825) will help to ensure optimal performance.

The Ryzen 5 1600 is a [great processor](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/AMD/Ryzen_5_1600/). It has 6 cores and 12 threads, making it perfect not only for gaming, but other workstation tasks as well. 

It's new from AMD, and it blows Intel i5 CPUs out of the water. It's perfect for gaming, editing, streaming, etc.

### The Motherboard
![ASRock AB350 Pro4](/img/mobo/ab350-pro4.png "ASRock AB350 Pro4"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The [ASRock - AB350 Pro4 ATX AM4 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWF165R/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06WWF165R&linkId=da5f6cb6124adbfac2a435e219082ec9) was chosen for this build. It's a great choice for the build.  

This motherboard supports 2400 MHz ram. It has an AMD B350 chipset, and has 6 sata 6 GB/s ports as well. 

Unfortunately, this motherboard does not support SLI or Crossfire. However, considering the extremely high price of the GPU ([Due to ethereum mining](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/)), SLI just doesn't make sense. 

That aside, the motherboard is highly reviewed. I have used it before, and had no issues. In fact, I was quite fond of the BIOS' ease of use. 

Specs: 

* Form Factor: ATX
* CPU Socket: AM4
* Chipset: AMD B350
* Memory Slots: 4 x 288-pin DIMM
* Memory Type: DDR4-1866/2133/2400/2666/2933/3200
* Maximum Supported Memory: 64GB
* Raid Support: Yes
* Onboard Video: Depends on CPU
* Crossfire Support: No
* SLI Support: No
* Sata 6 GB/s
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps
* Onboard USB 3.0 Header(s): Yes

### The Ram
![2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x8.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x8GB"){: .img-medium .img-right}


Though some games still really only need 8GB of ram, 16GB is being recommended for many newer titles. Pretty soon, 16GB of ram will be mainstream. 

Since this is an enthusiast build, we tried to "futureproof" the build. 

[2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory was chosen for the build. Since 16GB of ram was selected, as well as the rise in GPU prices due to [ethereum mining](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/), an SSD was not in the budget. 

From a gaming standpoint, the SSD does nothing for performance in game other than loading speeds. It is merely a luxury item. 

That being said, an SSD would be ideal. [You can shop for an SSD and easily add it to the build.](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=SSD&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) 

All in all, 16GB of ram will be much more beneficial to gaming performance than an SSD.

Specs: 

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* 16GB (2 x 8GB)
* CAS Latency: 15
* Voltage: 1.2V
* Heat Spreader: Yes
* ECC: No
* Registered: No
* Color: Black/Red

### The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue 1TB Hard Drive](/img/hdd/1tb.png "1TB Caviar Blue HDD"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The name WD Caviar Blue carries many attributes with it: 

* Mass Storage
* Reliability
* Simplicity
* Speed

These are just a few of the many benefits of owning a WD Caviar Blue 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM internal hard drive. 

Not only is this hard drive fast, it is reliable, and cost effective. 

Unfortunately as mentioned earlier, an SSD was not in the budget. However, [you can easily purchase one in addition to the build.](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=SSD&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg)
