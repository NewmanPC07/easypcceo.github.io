![Corsair Obsidian Series - 750D Airflow Edition](/img/case/corsair-750d-airflow.png "Corsair Obsidian Series - 750D Airflow Edition"){: .img-medium .img-right}

This case was designed specifically to provide the best airflow. This case will perfectly suit the build. 

The case is huge and spacious on the inside, with plenty of room for case fans. It has plenty of space for a water cooling unit, as well as cables. It's excellent for first time builders. 

This case has a streamlined enclosure, designed primarily for liquid cooling.

### The Processor 
![Ryzen 7 1700X](/img/cpu/ryzen7.jpg "Ryzen 7 1700X"){: .img-right .img-medium}


Ryzen 7 is one of the best lines of CPUs to ever be released in terms of price to performance. In fact, the performance alone is impressive. 

The Ryzen 7 1700X has proven itself as a big threat to Intel's CPUs. I'd recommend Ryzen 7 over Intel's i7 CPUs. 

The Ryzen 7 1700X has 8 physical cores. In addition, it features simaltaneous multithreading. This means each core has 2 threads. 

With 8 physical cores and 8 theoretical cores, this CPU will dominate any task thrown at it. 

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.8 GHz
* Cores: 8
* Lithography: 14 nm
* TDP: 95 Watts
* Simultaneous Multithreading: Yes

### The CPU Cooler 
![Corsair H100i v2 Water Cooler](/img/cpu/h100iv2.png "Corsair H100i v2 Water Cooler"){: .img-medium .img-right}


Aftermarket air cooled CPU coolers definitely get the job done. They even have potential to support light overclocking. 

However, if you're serious about pushing your CPU to its max frequency, water cooling is the way to go. 

For this build, the [Corsair - H100i v2 70.7 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019EXSSBG/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B019EXSSBG&linkId=028c0d865a4c40a3f04d72bcca449dae) was chosen.  

This cooler is quite popular and mainstream. It boasts extreme performance and ease of use. 

Corsair Link comes built in, allowing the user to track temperatures, adjust performance and customize LED lighting from the desktop. 

It features a 240mm radiator and advanced SP120L PWM fans. With this cooler, you can safely boost your CPU to a much higher operating frequency. 

Specs: 

* Model: H100i v2
* Liquid Cooled: Yes
* Radiator Size: 240mm
* Noise Level: 37.7 dbA
* Fan RPM: 2435 RPM

### The Motherboard
![MSI - X370 Gaming Plus ATX AM4 Motherboard](/img/mobo/msi-x370.png "MSI - X370 Gaming Plus ATX AM4 Motherboard"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The [MSI - X370 Gaming Plus ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZT5KCN/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06ZZT5KCN&linkId=3824989e1b15927780f573467d3a17b1) was chosen for this build. 

This motherboard's BIOS is excellent for overclocking, especially if it's your first time. MSI Afterburner allows for simple and easy overclocking.  

This is one of the cheapest motherboards on the market that is equipped with the AMD X370 chipset in the retail market. 

Despite this, it's still an extremely functional board, with all of the features you'd need for the build. 

Specs: 

* Form Factor: ATX
* CPU Socket: AM4
* Chipset: AMD X370

### The Ram
![2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x8.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x8GB"){: .img-medium .img-right}


Though some games still really only need 8GB of ram, 16GB is being recommended for many newer titles. Pretty soon, 16GB of ram will be mainstream. 

Since this is an enthusiast build, we tried to "futureproof" the build. 

[2 x 8GB (16GB) of G.Skill - Ripjaws V Series 2400 memory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013J7T5K6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013J7T5K6&linkId=c9c90987a892dc655f57b6ef465af49f) was chosen for the build. 16GB of ram is always nice to have.  

Most games don't utilize more than 8GB of ram. However, some newer games are recommending the use of 12GB and even 16GB of ram. With such a high end build, 16GB is a must. 

Specs: 

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* 16GB (2 x 8GB)
* CAS Latency: 15
* Voltage: 1.2V
* Heat Spreader: Yes

### The Solid State Drive
![PNY CS1311 120GB SSD](/img/hdd/pny-cs1311.png "PNY CS1311 120GB SSD"){: .img-medium .img-right}


In most builds, I skip the SSD and use the money for a more important part like the graphics card. 

The SSD has no impact on FPS or graphical settings. However, an SSD does significantly increase boot speeds and loading times. 

It's always nice to have an SSD, and in a build like this, it could not be left out. 

For this build, the [PNY - CS1311 120GB 2.5" Solid State Drive](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019H3B3P6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B019H3B3P6&linkId=77be3f485e80ccfa4722ebf0495640ae) was chosen. This SSD doesn't have a ton of storage, but it's more than enough for your OS, drivers, and some of your favorite games. 

Specs: 

* Capacity: 120GB
* Interface: Sata 6 Gb/s
* Form Factor: 2.5" 

### The Graphics Card
![MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition Graphics Card](/img/gpu/msi-1080-fe.png "MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition Graphics Card"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The graphics card is easily the most important part of any gaming PC. Any well optimized PC game will mainly utilize the power of the GPU. 

GPUs are used for more than just gaming. In fact, they are also the biggest tool in a [miner's](/crypto-mining/) toolbelt. 

The GPU chosen for this build is the [MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition Graphics Card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FX2KS6U/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01FX2KS6U&linkId=8494cc499c74ac1bce618b87ed720400). This GPU is among the best, if not the best gaming GPUs on the market. Furthermore, it's a [great ethereum miner.](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) 

Due to [ethereum mining](/crypto-mining/ethereum-hardware/) the price of this GPU has skyrocketed. Still, it's an excellent GPU and will achieve the highest possible framerates with excellent resolutions and graphical settings. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: GeForce GTX 1080
* Memory Size: 8GB

### The Power Supply 
![Corsair CXM 750W](/img/PSU/cx750m.png "Corsair CXM 750W PSU"){: .img-medium .img-right}


The [Corsair - CXM 750W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi Modular ATX power supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ALK3KEM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00ALK3KEM&linkId=a690f5e6b8491817eff0824833895bcb) was chosen for the build. 

It's semi modular, which helps keep the cables nice and tidy, as well as improve airflow within the case. 

The build draws about 400W, but overclocking is intended with this build. After overclocking the CPU and GPU, 750W is more than enough. It also leaves room for an SLI configuration in the future. 

Specs: 

* Manufacturer: Corsair
* Model: CX750M 
* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 750 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
