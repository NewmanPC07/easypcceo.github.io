Easy PC is a website designed to help beginner builders with their first PCs.

My name is Jacob Tuwiner. I made this site because I was once in your position, tirelessly researching the best computer components for my new gaming PC. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't find all the information I needed in one place. I wanted a hub of information for new PC enthusiasts. 

I decided to make this website to bring all of the information you need in one place. This website is designed to cover everything PC hardware related, including gaming PCs, cryptocurrency mining hardware, gaming desks, chairs, monitors and more. 

## More Information

I've always had a passion for PC building and technology. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to get in touch with me.
