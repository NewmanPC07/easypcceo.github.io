![Cooler Master Hyper D92](/img/cpu-coolers/hyper-d92.png){: .img-right .img-small}

The CM Hyper D92 was designed to outperform the CM Hyper 212 Evo for a slightly higher price tag. This cooler has great cooling performance and lots of cool features. 

It features two fans that can easily be attatched with the plastic fan clips. It includes everything you'll need to get started. 

The D92 keeps temperatures low even with overclocked chips. It's great for the average gamer. It also is a great buy for mid range builds.

## Price

The Cooler Master Hyper D92 can be found on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=10&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=Cooler+Master+Hyper+D92&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) or [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2xzE0C6) for around $40. The CPU cooler is reasonably priced, especially for the performance you'll receive. 

If you are proactive, you'll probably be able to find the cooler on sale. With mail-in rebates, the cooler can be bought for an even lower price.

## What's in the Box

Straight out of the box you'll receive the CM Hyper D92, the user manual with warranty information, as well as mounting hardware for both AMD/Intel platforms. 

In addition, you'll receive all the screws and bolts needed for installation, and a small syringe of thermal paste.

This cooler has a cool added feature. Unlike most coolers with wire clips, this cooler ships with plastic fan clips. 

This cooler has two 92 mm fans which you simply clip on and off with ease. 

## Installation 

Cooler Master has once again provided a simple installation experience for their consumers with the Hyper D92. 

The installation process of this cooler is easy. All of the installation requirements are included in the box. 

Simply mount the back plate underneath the motherboard and attatch the included standoffs. 

Next, attatch the bracket that goes between the cooler and the standoffs. Once again, all of the screws, brackets, and standoffs are included in the packaging. 

## Design 

Just like the [CM Hyper 212 Evo](/cpu-coolers/hyper-212-evo-review/), the D92 has 4 direct contact heat pipes. 

The fans come preassembled on the cooler so you can't get the configuration confused. They're different fans, one blowing down and one blowing up. 

This is Cooler Master's 'push-pull' technology. One fan pulls cool air in while the other fan exhausts the hot air. 

The seperate fans each have a 4 pin connector. If you'd like to save fan headers on your motherboard, the D92 ships with a fan splitter. This also helps to ensure both fans are running at the same speed. Another nice feature of the Hyper D92. 

## Size 

This cooler is slightly larger than the CM 212 Evo. The dimensions are as follows: 146.4 x 128.9 x 96.6 mm

It's defnitely not the world's smallest CPU cooler, but it's not huge either. It'll fit well in most builds. 

No need to worry about memory clearance. If you're using a Micro-ATX board, it might be a tight fit, but it should be okay. 

No need to worry about memory clearance. If you're using a Micro-ATX board, it might be a tight fit, but it should be okay. 

Just ensure your case is large enough for the cooler. Most mid tower cases and even micro-ATX cases should support the cooler. Obviously full tower cases will as well. 

## Fan Specs 

* **Dimensions:** 92 x 92 x 25 mm
* **Speed:** 800-2800 RPM
* **Air Flow:** 15.7-54.8 CFM
* **Life Expectancy:** 40,000 hours 

## Performance 

The cooler was tested for 10 minutes with an Intel 3960X running at 4.5 GHz. 

Starting things off with the Prime 95 test, the Hyper D92 maintained a temperature of 77 degrees celcius. 

Moving on to the next test, Battlefield  4. The Hyper D92 saw temperatures of no more than 67 degrees celcius. 

Lastly, it saw temperatures no more than 61 degrees celcius in vanilla Minecraft. 

All in all, this cooler kept the CPU at adequate temperatures considering the stress placed on the overclocked CPU. 

However, the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo saw nearly identical performance for a much lower price tag.

## Noise 

The Hyper D92 is quiet, emitting slightly less noise than its cheaper counterpart, the Hyper 212 Evo. 

Standing two feet away while idling, the fans are barely audible. 

Cooler Master rates the Hyper D92 with a min dBa of 10 and a max dBa of 33. In our experience, the Cooler Master Hyper D92 is a quiet cooler when idling, and only a bit louder at heavier loads. 

All in all, noise levels won't be an issue with this CPU cooler. 

## Power Consumption 

The coolers rated current usage is .22 A and its rated voltage is 12 V. Cooler Master rates its power consumption at 2.88 W; evidently the cooler doesn't use much electricity.  

## Is it Right for You? 

Please note: the free stock cooler you'll receive with your CPU will work perfectly at clock speeds. 

If you decide to purchase an unlocked Intel chip, or a [Ryzen](https://www.techspot.com/review/1450-core-i7-vs-ryzen-5-hexa-core/) CPU, buying the Hyper D92 is probably a better choice. Since these chips are overclocker friendly, using an aftermarket cooler is optimal. 

If you purchase a high end chip like a Core i7-7700k, You'll probably want a better cooler than the D92 to support max frequency. This will ensure the most from your money. A [water cooler](http://pc-hardware-reviews.yoexpert.com/desktop-pcs/what-are-the-benefits-of-having-a-water-cooled-pc-3444.html) is probably your best option. 

## Conclusion 

Although the CM Hyper D92 will keep your CPU cool, you're probably better off buying the [CM Hyper 212 Evo](/cpu-coolers/hyper-212-evo-review/). In all three of our tests, the 212 Evo displayed practically identical performance for a lower price. 

However, the D92 is still a great cooler. Its two 92 mm fans work well together to ensure low temperatures. It handles overclocking well, and it's a good choice for low end to mid range builds.
