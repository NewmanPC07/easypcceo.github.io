## What's in the Box

Straight out of the box you'll receive the CM Hyper 212 Evo, the user manual with warranty information, as well as mounting hardware for both AMD/Intel platforms. 

In addition, you'll receive all the screws and bolts needed for installation, and a small syringe of thermal paste.

## Installation 

The installation process of this cooler is simple and easy. All of the installation requirements are included in the box. 

Simply mount the back plate underneath the motherboard and attatch the included standoffs. 

Next, attatch the bracket that goes between the cooler and the standoffs. Once again, all of the screws, brackets, and standoffs are included in the packaging. 

## Size 

The 212 Evo isn't the largest cooler on the market. With the dimensions of 116 x 51 x 159 mm, it is on the smaller side. While it may not be the best choice for a compact PC, there won't be any issues mounting this cooler inside any mid tower or full tower case. 

The cooling power of the 212 Evo makes up for its smaller size. It features a 120mm fan that does a great job; furthermore, it's extremely quiet.  Just make sure it'll fit your case before you decide to purchase the cooler.

![212 Evo](/img/cpu-coolers/212-evo-size.jpg)

## Design 

The cooler's design is an average height, single tower cooler. It features 4 heat pipes with Cooler Master's continuous direct contact technology. 

The build quality overall is good. With the fan attatched, the cooler weighs in at 569g. 

RAM clearance shouldn't be an issue. If needed, the fan can be raised to accomodate your RAM.

This cooler is compatible with nearly all chipsets and motherboards, including lga 1151 motherboards. Unfortunately, an AMD AM4 upgrade kit may be needed for this cooler if you choose a Ryzen CPU. 

## Fan Specs

* **120 mm**
* **600-2000RPM**
* **4 pin-pwm connector**
* **9-36dBa noise level**
* **24.9-82.9 CFM**

## Performance

The cooler was tested with an Intel Core i7-4790K with all 8 threads clocked at 4.4 GHz. The automatic voltage was set to 1.25 V.

The 212 Evo was able to keep the chip at 76 degrees celcius (168.8 fahrenheit) with the fan running at the standard setting (remember this temperature was recorded at max load).

Considering the price tag of the 212 Evo, this performance is impeccable. 

## Noise 

Cooler Master notes the min dBa of this cooler is 9 while the max dBa is 36. This cooler runs quietly at normal settings. 

However, if you're overclocking the CPU, the noise level rises considerably. All in all, the noise level is quite low and shouldn't be an issue. 

Since the fan is a bit larger, it can spin at a lower speed and achieve the same degree of cooling. This keeps the cooler nice and quiet. 

## Power Consumption 

The CM Hyper 212 Evo's max TDP is rated at 180 watts. The fan's rated current is .22 A and its rated voltage is 12 V. Cooler Master rates its power consumption at 2.64 W; evidently the cooler doesn't use much electricity.  

## Is it Right for You? 

Please note that the free stock cooler you'll receive with your CPU will work perfectly at clock speeds. 

If you decide to purchase an unlocked Intel chip, or a [Ryzen](https://www.techspot.com/review/1450-core-i7-vs-ryzen-5-hexa-core/) CPU, buying the 212 Evo is probably a better choice. Since these chips are overclocker friendly, using an aftermarket cooler is optimal. 

If you purchase a high end chip like a Core i7-7700k, You'll probably want a better cooler than the 212 Evo to support max frequency. This will ensure the most from your money. 

## Conclusion 

The CM 212 Evo is a brilliant cooler for the money. It may not have the best performance on the market, but it definitely boasts fantastic value for the money. 

Keep in mind that the stock cooler provided with your CPU should perform just fine. However, if you want to prolong the life of your CPU, the 212 Evo is a viable option. In addition, if you're looking for a cheap overclocking solution, this cooler is a valid choice.

This cooler is perfect for the average gamer, and even supports some overclocking. All in all, it's a great stock cooler alternative for only $30.
