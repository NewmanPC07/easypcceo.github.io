The CPU cooler is a crucial component of any PC. A CPU cannot operate without a CPU cooler. It'll overheat within minutes.

In fact, you can fry an egg on a CPU that is running without a CPU cooler. Crazy right? 

If your CPU doesn't stay cool it'll shut itself off to prevent damgage. If you want your CPU to function properly, you'll need a proper CPU cooler. 

## Things to Consider 

There are many factors to consider when buying a CPU cooler for your rig. 

Air coolers and water coolers from low end coolers designed for a cheap gaming PC all the way up to expensive coolers for highly overclocked PCs. 

### Air Coolers 

Air coolers are the most common CPU cooling systems. They are cheaper and easier to install than liquid cooling systems. 

While they may not be as effective as a water cooling system, they still get the job done. 

Air cooling units have a heat conducting block which absorbs the heat radiated by the CPU. From here, it sends the heat up through the CPU fan and out through the PC's exhaust vent. 

Air coolers are typically the best route to go if you're a new builder. Even if you have some experience under your belt, a water cooling unit can be a hassle, and it's often unnecessary. 

Air CPU coolers are cheap, easy, and efficient. 

### Water Coolers 

Liquid cooling units are popular among enthusiast builders as they are more efficient and leave the case looking clean and empty. 

The cooling process is obviously different, using liquid coolant which is driven to the case fans that exhaust the heat. 

While air coolers do a great job and even support some [overclocking](https://www.howtogeek.com/165064/what-is-overclocking-the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-understanding-how-geeks-speed-up-their-pcs/), if you truly want to push your CPU to its max potential, you'll probably want a liquid cooler. 

They're especially beneficial when you buy an expensive [unlocked CPU](http://www.velocitymicro.com/blog/intel-processors-locked-vs-unlocked-processor/) from Intel. You'll want the most from your money, and overclocking is the way to go. After all, these K model CPUs were designed with overclocking in mind. 

You'll probably also want to take a look at [Ryzen 5](http://www.anandtech.com/show/11244/the-amd-ryzen-5-1600x-vs-core-i5-review-twelve-threads-vs-four/17) CPUs as they're extremely overclocker friendly.
