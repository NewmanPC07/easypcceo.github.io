<h2 id="pyle-pvrc43---50"><a href="http://amzn.to/2E3ldTj" target="_blank">Pyle PVRC43</a> - $50</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2E3ldTj"><img alt="Pyle PVRC43" class="img-middle" src="/img/capture-cards/pvrc43.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> The <a href="http://amzn.to/2E3ldTj" target="_blank">Pyle PVRC43</a> is a standalone capture card, so it need not be connected to a computer to make it function. It has dimensions of 3.3” x 1.7” x 0.5” and an
output resolution of 640 x 480 Pixels. Its max video frame rate is 30 FPS.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This capture card has a max resolution of 480p. It is NOT HD.

<h2 id="hdml-cloner-box-evolve-2---122"><a href="http://amzn.to/2DwoTMi" target="_blank">HDML-Cloner Box Evolve 2</a> - $122</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2DwoTMi"><img alt="HDML-Cloner Box Evolve 2" class="img-middle" src="/img/capture-cards/evolve.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Cloner Alliance is a company that is relatively new. It was founded recently in 2014 and their inventory consists of several video-focused hardware and software solutions. Though being new to the scene, the company has established a great reputation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://amzn.to/2DwoTMi" target="_blank">HDML-Cloner Box Evolve 2</a> is a sleek standalone capture card, having the capability of processing 4K video input and downscaling it to a 1080p resolution in 60 frames per second with maximum efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4K processing</strong> - It can process videos in <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/tv-resolution-confusion-1080p-2k-uhd-4k-and-what-they-all-mean/" target="_blank">4K resolution</a>. This is a rare feature present among capture cards nowadays, as 4K resolution still isn’t mainstream like 1080p. Though the Evolve 2 may not be able to record videos at this high resolution, the downscaled 1080p version of the video is H.264-encoded which means that the video will still retain high quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Storage options</strong> - The Evolve 2 can store recorded footage in 3 different ways: a TF memory card (up to 32 GB), a USB flash drive ( up to 2TB) or directly on your computer.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote control</strong> - The capture card has its own remote control which resembles the regular remote control of a television set.</li>
  <li><strong>Editing software</strong> - With the capture card comes Cloner Alliance’s own editing software. It is a very basic program. If you are keen to do any serious editing apart from trimming or splitting videos, you will have to opt for something more powerful.</li>
  <li><strong>Scheduled recording</strong> -  Especially useful when used with TVs, Evolve is able to record automatically. You just need to tell the capture card when it should do so.</li>
  <li><strong>Streaming capabilities and live commentary</strong> - The capture card has the capability to stream video and record your voice in real time which makes it an excellent choice for streamers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roxio-game-capture-hd-pro---110"><a href="http://amzn.to/2F8fdIm" target="_blank">Roxio Game Capture HD PRO</a> - $110</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2F8fdIm"><img class="img-middle" alt="Roxio Game Capture HD PRO" src="/img/capture-cards/roxio-hdpro.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Video quality</strong> - It records content in full high definition 1080p resolution, though only at 30 FPS. It lags behind some of the more powerful cards.</li>
  <li><strong>264 encoding</strong> - <a href="https://www.vcodex.com/an-overview-of-h264-advanced-video-coding/" target="_blank">H.264</a> undoubtedly represents the best compression technology currently available. The card enables you to capture high quality content and save space.</li>
  <li><strong>Analogue connectors</strong> - As the capture card was released towards the end of previous generation consoles, the Game Capture HD PRO contains a total of 10 RCA connectors in its design to facilitate this form of connection as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Live Streaming</strong> - It lets you stream console gameplay and commentary live directly to YouTube and TwitchTV. Also, you can auto test bandwidth for detecting live stream speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Editing and personalization facility</strong> - Users can edit H.264-encoded game videos and include one out of over 95 transitions, up to 6 picture-in-picture boxes, special effects, soundtracks, gamer-style text overlays and voice changed narration.</li>
  <li><strong>Share</strong> - The Game Capture HD PRO lets you share videos with one click to both YouTube and Facebook without leaving the capture software. You can post to Facebook or Tweet during live streaming of your gameplay.</li>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

  <li><strong>Portability</strong> - Though the capture card has dimensions of 8.1” x 6.5” ×2”, it isn’t bulky. Weighing a little over a pound, it is not too heavy. It lets you record footage directly to an SD card which suits you when you are not near your PC. If you’re at a friend’s house but still want to record, it’s the perfect card for you. It would also prove useful at big events like E3 if you want to record new unreleased games.</li>

<p>Internal capture cards provide a multitude of advantages over external cards.</p>

<p>Although they’re not portable, they do provide the lowest latency and typically the highest overall video quality. They connect via your motherboard’s PCIe connector which is faster than a USB 3.0 connection.</p>
